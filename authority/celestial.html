    <h1>18:20</h1>

    <p>&#8220;Black, no sugar.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Carolyn allowed herself a brief pause to double take. Here, in her cramped
      little kitchen, amongst the debris of breakfast, that enigmatic woman from
      the future, who seemed to be taking over the world single-handed, was telling
      her how she took her coffee. Things like that would take some getting used
      to.</p>

    <p>As would her appearance. At first glance, her outfit looked maybe a
      hundred years out of date, the long dark blue skirt and starched-looking
      white blouse &#8212; but the severe lines of the latter, without pleats or any
      other sort of decoration at the front, and short, simple sleeves rather than
      the expected Edwardian leg-of-mutton style, looked later, more military
      indeed in its severity. Were it not that the Visitor were a couple of cup
      sizes smaller than the typical prototype, it was of a style would not seem
      amiss being worn by one of the decorative Valkyries in a dubious war film. A
      little bit <cite>Zelda, Nazi Werewolf</cite> was what came to mind when she
      thought of what the outfit looked like.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Half right,&#8221; the Visitor spoke, breaking the chain of thought. &#8220;I'd
      better properly introduce myself. Formally, I'm the Lady Nancy Elanor of the
      clan Wolf, but Nancy, or even Annie, will do for day to day informal use. I
      hope we can be that much at ease together.</p>

    <p>&#8220;And I'm afraid that my Clan has at times been labelled in terms that are
      not too different from what you might understand by National Socialist. I
      hasten to add that the events that led to that label were over centuries
      before I was conceived.</p>

    <p>&#8220;This is roughly contemporary fashion in my old home environment. It's not
      a time-traveller's mix and match slightly off the mark guess at something
      like what was being worn around the turn of the third millennium. We never
      had the long underwear future that your epoch seemed so fond of in your
      romances of the future, though skirts are really only practical in reliable
      gravity environments.&#8221;</p>

    <p>She paused for a moment for thought.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Sorry, I'm still not used to the setting here &#8212; too much time amongst the
      Ascended in recent years. I've been reading your mind, rather than waiting
      for you to vocalise, which has been rather rude of me.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Carolyn took advantage of the pause for breath to fire up the coffee
      grinder. As she shook it to ensure an even grind, she wondered why all this
      was happening to her. Life had been so much simpler when she had woken up
      that morning. If only she could wind back the clock&#8230;</p>

    <p>And then it struck her &#8212; that was exactly what the Visitor had been doing,
      but on a larger scale. She started to giggle, but it came out as a sob. Too
      much stress, she thought, blinking her eyes clear.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Everything will turn out right. That's what I'm here for.&#8221; There was a
      cool touch on her arm, as the Visitor spoke from right behind her as she
      stood facing the breakfast bar with the grinder and coffee machine. Carolyn
      looked at the hand resting on her arm. It was small, with long fingers, the
      ring finger's length matching the middle, and very hairy, with copious fine,
      pale down right up to the nails. The skin beneath the down had a greyish
      cast. She turned around, and looked into her guest's face, which showed clear
      worry and concern, and&#8230;</p>

    <p>It took a moment's thought to work out what was strange about that face.
      The eyebrows, which formed a solid bar across her forehead and down the front
      of her ears until they blended with her hair. And all the rest was covered
      with more of the down.</p>

    <p>There is a word for things that are nearly, but not quite human. That word
      is <cite>monster</cite>. Here, staring the Visitor in the face, she knew that
      she was in the presence of something alien. Her heart raced, and she felt
      herself break out in a cold sweat. Barely suppressed terror churned her
      insides.</p>

    <p>Get a grip, girl! she chided herself. She took a deep breath, which she
      managed to avoid turning into a sob.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I'm sorry,&#8221; she muttered, &#8220;It's just everything happening at once. It was
      bad enough at the conference today, and now this&#8230;</p>

    <p>Carolyn paused, tipped the coffee into the filter cone, added water to the
      machine's reservoir, and switched it on. With that simple everyday action
      done, she had an opportunity to gather her thoughts, to try to compose
      herself.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Ms Wolf, I think I must have missed at least one word in three of what
      you said, because I don't know where you're coming from. I can see that you
      are &#8212; must be &#8212; from somewhere out of space and time, but you have to explain
      everything else to me. You might be able to read my mind, but I can't read
      yours. You'll have to put everything into words.&#8221;</p>

    <p>The Visitor looked thoughtful. &#8220;At least one part in three, at least
      consciously.&#8221; she remarked, enigmatically.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Where to start? There is so much to say. So much I need to convey.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;So, let's start with an easy one &#8212; or I hope is easy. Who &#8212; or what &#8212; are
      you?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Technically, I suppose I'm an illegal alien. I'm a genetically modified
      human clone, born on a planet a couple of kiloparsecs from here.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;The legal term means you entered the country without papers.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Oh, and that too. I've enough to worry about without humouring
      bureaucrats.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;But why did you come to me?. I'd've expected a landing on the White House
      lawn, or maybe Downing Street if you came here rather than the States.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Leaders may be very well placed in your power structures, but they are
      too concerned with the spectacle and the status quo and the defined
      diplomatic channels. I'm here to build a finer world, to heal or, more often,
      cut out its sickness &#8212; Engineer and Doctor all in one. I can't start on
      diplomacy &#8212; I have to start with action, enough to establish myself as a
      Power to reckon with.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I need things to happen that will in the end change everything those
      leaders control. Your conference, for one. It was a seed &#8212; one of many but
      significant for all that &#8212; a seed that didn't blossom as wildly as it could
      have, for the Ascension as it happened in my history.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;But what about the rest of you?&#8221; Carolyn didn't like this being singled
      out, but the Visitor just threw her head back and laughed, displaying perfect
      white teeth. She felt acutely how this contrasted with her own snaggle teeth,
      much abused by piecework rate NHS dentistry in childhood. Movie star teeth,
      this woman out of the future had.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, as the coffee machine gurgled behind her, the perception
      shifted, and she realised what the Visitor reminded her of &#8212; an old black and
      white photo of some forgotten starlet, but brought to life in the round, like
      Betty Boop had been in <cite>Roger Rabbit</cite>. The monster had been
      replaced by the absurd, bringing a wry smile to her face.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I'm all there is. The thing in orbit is just a standard Stargate chassis,
      full of Engines.&#8221; Carolyn heard the capital letter, and got the impression of
      vast masses in motion. &#8220;OK, it's customised to self-enfold, but it's all run
      with sub-sapient automation &#8212; but that's all I should need for what I have to
      do. Most of the job can be handled by social insect level AIs, and I have
      templates for raptors when I have to handle the inevitable occasional
      unpleasantnesses.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Carolyn started to frame a question, but there were too many implied by
      everything she had heard. She took a deep breath, and tried to take charge of
      the conversation.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Everything you say assumes I know almost everything you do, that I come
      from your time, or at least, that I'm at home there. I have a hundred
      questions now, but I'm not even going to play that game and start asking
      them. Please, in simple terms a primitive like me can understand, what is it
      you are trying to do? And, more importantly what is it you want me to do?&#8221;</p>

    <p>The Visitor looked up directly into Carolyn's eyes, and tilted her head, a
      slightly quizzical expression on her face, spoilt slightly by an all too
      knowing smile. There were faint aromatic scents, exotic flavours in her
      nostrils, hints of deep musky perfume that tantalised. Half aghast, Carolyn
      fought back the impulse to hold the woman tight to her, to feel another close
      to her, warm and reassuring, chiding herself for feeling so tired and alone
      and vulnerable.</p>

    <p>&#8220;What I want you to do is to go on with what you would have done anyway,
      only this time, I will be assisting you. That way you should be successful
      beyond your wildest hopes. Meanwhile I shall be doing what is necessary to
      allow that success to happen in a more reasonable world.&#8221;</p>

    <p>The moment had passed. Carolyn let out the breath she had been holding,
      knowing that she could let the tickle of arousal she felt be subordinate to
      business.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I <em>think</em> I'm flattered. And I think I'm going to have to ask more
      questions. What is this Ascension you spoke about this morning, and what is
      it you are trying to change about it?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I think that some of this will involve showing rather than telling. We
      will have to go for a walk, but for that, I'm going to have to change.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;You mean put your burkha on again? Or did you want to borrow something of
      mine? It might be a bit large on you.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;No, change as in metamorphose. Rather than walk around again in that
      demeaning and, uh, somewhat conspicuous outfit, just to hide the fact that
      I'm not a Pink, I'm going to make use of one of the odd things that it amused
      the Ascended to build into the genotypes they gave to my ancestors, and
      change into a wolf.</p>

    <p>&#8220;While I'm transformed, I shan't be able to speak, and I can't project
      anything abstract or verbalised, so I'll just have to play guide dog.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I don't know if you will want to watch. But first, isn't that coffee
      ready? I'm gasping for a cup.&#8221;</p>

    <p>She turned around. Indeed it was ready, and she poured two cups.</p>

    <p>&#8220;You did say black, didn't you?&#8221;</p>

    <h1>18:45</h1>

    <p>Carolyn nursed her now empty cup for the last vestiges of warmth as she
      slumped in her armchair. Across the little living-room, the woman &#8212; Lady Wolf
      &#8212; waited for her.</p>

    <p>No more excuse for putting things off. It was time to make the decision to
      get onto the roller-coaster, blessedly abandoning responsibility to
      another.</p>

    <p>&#8220;So, where are we going?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Immediately, to my hopper, then up to the <cite>Secret Rose</cite> &#8212; the
      Stargate. I'm parked under water near Blackfriars. It's stealthed, but even
      so, it would be asking for trouble leaving it out in the open.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Now, you go and put your raincoat on, or whatever, as the rain is setting
      in now, while I go and change.&#8221;</p>

    <p>And so saying, she wandered off into the bedroom, leaving Carolyn suddenly
      apprehensive, in all the normal ways &#8212; did it look too like a Tracy Emin
      exhibit, were various drawers discreetly closed &#8212; before deciding that was
      not worth the effort. Let the bitch see the shambles &#8212; surely women in her
      future still functioned in much the same way as they did here and now.
      Meanwhile, she would rummage under the lighter weight clothes hung on the
      coat rack for her heaviest, hooded, raincoat.</p>

    <p>She had located it and was pulling it on when the bedroom door opened, and
      a sleek grey wolf loped out, wearing a collar and lead, with the lead on a
      spool it &#8212; she &#8212; carried in her mouth. Carolyn felt the hairs on the back of
      her neck crawl, despite the very down to earth extensible leash. The wolf
      walked right up to her, sat down, and stretched its head up at her.</p>

    <p>After a moment, she realised what was going on. &#8220;Walkies, is it?&#8221; and took
      the proffered lead. &#8220;I must apologise &#8212; I've never owned a dog before.&#8221; The
      gravelly snarl implied that the humour was not really appreciated.</p>

    <p>The weather outside was, as promised, foul. With one hand holding the
      lead, and the other clutching at the hood of her coat to keep gusts of wind
      from catching it, she felt at the mercy of this creature that was leading her
      into who knows what. At least in the clearer cold air, with the rain closing
      the world in around her, she felt that she could think for herself, and not
      just with her urges for warmth and snuggling.</p>

    <p>How &#8212; morally, as much as in consideration of capability &#8212; could she help
      this creature, this murderer who had cast her own thunderbolts from on high
      in the arbitrary savage justice of an antique god? How many had died at her
      hand, and for what end? Was she herself being, had she, been beguiled into
      complicity?</p>

    <p>And yet with the other hand, the Visitor was giving away just the sort of
      information that would normally be licensed at prices beyond what needy
      nations &#8212; needy folk &#8212; could afford. If she were serious about assisting her
      own efforts to bridge the data divide, and could bring similar resources to
      bear, then might it be acceptable to find a long enough spoon and sup with
      this particular devil?</p>

    <p>In this bleak frame of mind, she emerged from the side streets on to the
      Gray's Inn Road, where the traffic was sizzling along in the standing water
      gathering on the carriageway. Taking care to avoid the worst of the puddles,
      and the spray thrown up by the traffic, she picked her way south amongst the
      thin trickle of desperate pedestrians.</p>

      <div class="hide" style="float:right;">
        <div style="padding:5px;border: black 1px solid;text-align: center;background-color: #eee;color:inherit">
          <img height="512" width="512" src="bing240217-202257_0955.jpg"
            alt="a woman and a wolf walk down a London street at evening" />
        </div>
      </div>
  
    <p>As they walked, the alternation of flats with little shops and busy
      takeaways gave way to more upmarket cafes and commercial buildings, mostly
      deserted at this hour. As they approached Theobald's Road, the wolf broke
      into a lope, and Carolyn followed, dragged along by the eager pace of her
      guide, dashing across the the junction in small gaps in the traffic,
      oblivious to the pouring rain.</p>

    <p>Chancery Lane Underground station and its subway provided a welcome
      shelter from the rain at about the half way point in the journey. As she
      reached the bottom of the steps, Carolyn pushed back her hood and tucked one
      chilled hand into a pocket for warmth. She waited for her companion to shake
      herself dry, keeping drawn back against another shower.</p>

    <p>But while she herself was drenched, and dripping, the Visitor's canine
      alter ego seemed to be completely dry. She rubbed the furry head, finding it
      indeed dry and warm, and receiving a rather smug looking stare for her
      pains.</p>

    <p>&#8220;What's your special trick for keeping dry, girl?&#8221; she wondered. &#8220;More
      magic? Oh well, time for me at least to get wet again.&#8221;</p>

    <p>From the shelter of the subway, they emerged on the south side of Holborn,
      heading right from the rain swept arena of Holborn Circus, where St. Andrew's
      church stood stark and white amongst trees that were yet to show the advance
      of autumn in mid October. After the open expanse, the office blocks &#8212; modern
      every decade since the 1960s &#8212; seemed to crowd in, dwarfing the occasional
      urban tree rising from the pavement.</p>

    <p>Ludgate opened out, with St. Paul's briefly visible beyond, and soon
      thereafter they were down in the subway around Blackfriars station. Not
      somewhere Carolyn would have cared to come alone at night, but escorted as
      she was, the panhandlers here for shelter kept to themselves as the two of
      them navigated to where the Embankment ended at Blackfriars Bridge.</p>

    <p>Emerging once more into the elements, they turned right, and down on to
      the riverside walkway leading to Cannon Street and the belatedly reopened
      Millennium Bridge. Expecting to follow that path, she was brought up short as
      the Visitor stepped towards the river, and leapt over the balustrade.</p>

    <p>She stopped, ready for the jolt as the lead terminated the plunge. She did
      not expect a steady and growing pull. Carefully she stepped to the edge to
      look, and could hardly believe her eyes, as the silver wolf stood there in
      mid air, tugging on the lead.</p>

    <p>Resignedly, she followed &#8212; she could hardly get any colder and wetter,
      though the water was low enough to show large concrete blocks ten, fifteen
      feet below &#8212; and found some form of yielding support which let her walk
      cautiously down under the bridge, and around the first supporting column.
      There, in some measure of concealment, the wolf stopped and sat, and Carolyn
      stopped behind her and waited.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Now what?&#8221;</p>

    <p>There was a disturbance in the water, and something looking like a
      migraine rose from the surface. When it had cleared the water, the Visitor
      stepped forward into it, and Carolyn forced herself to follow into the eye
      hurting maelstrom.</p>

    <p>And suddenly, they were standing in a small open topped vehicle, a bit
      like an over-sized sports convertible. The Visitor sat on one of the couches,
      then rocked slightly back on to her hind feet, lifting her forepaws up, in a
      stereotypical pose as if begging for a treat. And then continued to
      straighten up, arms and legs becoming longer and stockier, muzzle drawing in,
      cranium swelling.</p>

    <p>In a half-human shape, the metamorphosis paused.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Could you hand me the lead?&#8221; the wolf-woman growled.</p>

    <p>Carolyn was only too happy to comply, and continued to watch in
      fascination as the lead flowed into functional olive drab shirt and trousers,
      while their wearer finally straightened and adjusted into fully human shape,
      the fur gathering &#8212; mostly &#8212; into long silver locks.</p>

    <p>&#8220;That feels better.&#8221; Nancy exclaimed &#8220;Now, let's be on our way. Sit down,
      so I can close the canopy, please.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Carolyn did so, settling into the plush upholstery. She was reminded of
      being driven in a petrolhead acquaintance's TVR, only this was more
      comfortable and opulent. Out of reflex, she felt around for some form of seat
      belt while a transparent dome flowed out of the sides of the cockpit, and
      closed over them.</p>

    <p>&#8220;We're higher tech than that. If we need restraints, it will happen.&#8221; she
      was advised, &#8220;so just relax, and enjoy the ride.&#8221;</p>

    <p>There was some low whistling noise, and a slight feeling of acceleration,
      as suddenly the street-lit blur that was London in the rain started to fall
      away behind them.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Do you mind if we have some music on? &#8212; I prefer to have some while
      driving.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Sure, whatever.&#8221; Carolyn replied, nonplussed at the mundane request.
      Overlain on the sound of the engines, a wall of loud unstructured noise burst
      forth. No, not noise, she corrected herself, but something very densely
      structured, composed of many different rhythmic and melodic lines, with an
      urgent tempo binding them together.</p>

    <p>Caught up in analysing the structure of the music, she scarcely noticed as
      they climbed up into the cloud, and then burst out into the clear night.</p>

    <p>&#8220;We'll be heading west &#8212; the <cite>Rose</cite> is passing over the
      Americas at the moment &#8212; so we'll be getting back into daylight as we head
      out over the Atlantic.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Already the western horizon was lightening, and starting to look curved,
      and as she watched the sunset turning into dawn, the commingled polyrhythms
      of the music resolved into a single melody that tore at her heart, and an
      almost angelic vocal line soared above it.</p>

    <p>The music had exploded back into its original complexity before they had
      passed into full daylight, but then even with the Sun brightening from red to
      blinding glare, the sky was still dark. Below, swirls of cloud over dark
      turquoise shaded into sunset behind them, the edge of night cutting across
      the plainly curved face of the ocean.</p>

    <p>&#8220;We now have line of sight on our destination, so I can open the throttles
      properly. We'll also be heading almost into the Sun, so I'm going to put the
      forward view on virtual.&#8221;</p>

    <p>The glare abruptly cut off, and an entirely viewable pale golden disk with
      a grainy texture took the place of the Sun, and between it and the horizon, a
      smaller ring. The nose of the craft rose towards this target, and suddenly
      the Earth was falling away behind them.</p>

    <p>Carolyn turned to look behind, to watch the expanse of water behind turn
      into a veritable globe, the outline of the Americas discernable under cloud,
      then stabilise, tilting from behind to beneath once more. Sunlight shone
      again from above, and ahead&#8230;</p>

    <p>If this was what had been captured as a clean ring of light on that
      morning's front page, it had now undergone a terrible change. The ring was
      obvious still, looming as large as the Earth, and inside it, maybe a third as
      far across, a dark mass wreathed in mist that was bright in the light, with
      lighter and darker veins running through it.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Working medium,&#8221; she was told, &#8220;Snagged a comet so the matter compilers
      have a large enough supply of volatiles.&#8221;</p>

    <p>The ring grew, came closer, as they manoeuvred into its plane, began to
      eclipse the smoking mass.</p>

    <p>&#8220;There are a few hundred megatons of carbon &#8212; about what you burn every
      couple of months, and more water and ammonia &#8212; but enough, say, to give
      everyone down there a few body-weights' worth of food, shelter, medicine
      each. And if it turns out we need more, there are plenty more where this one
      came from.&#8221;</p>

    <p>The ring was now a wall running along the left side of the car, lit by
      oblique sunlight that cast elongated shadows, and then swung around, to
      become a ceiling. A patch of darkness swelled above, engulfed them.</p>

    <p>The sudden transition left her eyes full of red-green after image, and
      some time passed before she realised that they were now in a space lit with
      much more subdued &#8212; but perfectly adequate &#8212; intensity. The craft settled
      gently into a cradle beneath, little jolts telling of its being latched into
      place. One final gesture at the controls and then</p>

    <p>&#8220;Welcome aboard the <cite>Secret Rose</cite>.&#8221;</p>

    <h1>19:30</h1>

    <p>&#8220;In here.&#8221;</p>

    <p>The door opened to reveal an opulent bathroom, with mirrored walls,
      alternately plain, and lightly tinted a more steely grey. Floor, furnishings
      and ceiling were of a black marble, strongly veined in cream and tawny. A
      faint floral perfume hung in the warm air, and distant strains of some
      complex melody kept the antiseptic silence of the corridors at bay.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Damp things in there, towels in this cupboard,&#8221; Nancy opened one of the
      mirrored panels to reveal a stack of large, fluffy towels, &#8220;and when it's had
      a chance to take measurements, this one&#8221; &#8212; an empty space at the moment &#8212;
      &#8220;will have a new outfit for you. I'll be waiting outside in the lounge. See
      you in a few minutes!&#8221;</p>

    <p>And so saying, departed closing the door.</p>

    <p>Having emerged from the cosy confines of the little craft that had brought
      her here, Carolyn had soon been reminded that she was soaked through, the
      sitting having given more chance for the wet to soak through from her
      raincoat. Walking down the cool, clean, silent, deserted corridors from the
      hangar, she began to feel chilled, and her teeth started to chatter.</p>

    <p>Her guide had noticed her discomfort, and sweeping through a huge room
      furnished with comfortable chairs, and tables, led her into this bathroom.</p>

    <p>Placing her handbag on one marble shelf, she discarded her raincoat into
      the bin indicated. She kicked off soaked shoes, peeled off her pop-socks and
      trousers that were saturated almost to the knee, followed by her merely damp
      woolie.</p>

    <p>Standing there in her underwear, she grabbed one of the towels, which felt
      impossibly luxurious and reassuringly warm, and began to vigorously dry arms
      and legs. Between the towel, and the background warmth of the air, her hands
      and feet were beginning to feel more like live flesh than ice.</p>

    <p>She went to the clothes cupboard, and then paused. 'The hell with this,'
      she thought, taking another towel, and discarding bra and knickers, ' I am
      going to get properly warm and dry.' It did feel good, defiant and slightly
      wicked, to just bask here, naked and warm, though she did keep an eye on the
      door, and wish that the mirroring was not so relentless. It might not be so
      bad in your early twenties, as the Visitor seemed to be, but though she might
      work out regularly, Carolyn felt there was no denying that for her, forty was
      looming.</p>

    <p>Having achieved a reasonable state of warmth, she went to the no longer
      empty end cupboard, to find there a near duplicate of what she had been
      wearing, betrayed by the lack of labels, and of any sign of wear and tear &#8212;
      no failing elastic, no tiny stains or holes &#8212; even the shoes that showed no
      signs of scuffing or stretching, but still felt like old comfortable
      slippers. Confidence restored with physical comfort, she slung new coat and
      old handbag on one arm, and strode out into the lounge.</p>

    <p>Here, chairs and tables in shades of blue-grey and dark steel were
      scattered over a vast area of deep pile carpeting of slate grey, looking more
      like a luxurious airport lounge than anything domestic. The far wall was
      windowed, showing bright blazing stars and some veils of mist that toned well
      with the interior decor.</p>

    <p>Here, the background music was something much simpler, languid strings
      like a harp, with an antique feel to it, unlike what clearly had been the
      complex music of the future playing first in the car, then in the
      bathroom.</p>

    <p>&#8220;We've done a lot of things to the human species where I came from.
      Actually I'm coming up to my first century,&#8221; the Visitor &#8212; Nancy, announced,
      looking up from where she was reclining on a couch in the middle of this
      expanse. She was now wearing a long white dress that bared her left shoulder,
      but otherwise looked like something from a Greek statue, and raised a
      chrome-bright goblet in salute.</p>

    <p>&#8220;A century,&#8221; she continued, &#8220;at least in terms of subjective age. It's a
      bit odd trying to say what your age is, when outside, it's twelve hundred
      years before you would have first taken breath.</p>

    <p>&#8220;But anyway, please be seated, and join me for dinner.&#8221; She indicated a
      second couch, facing her. &#8220;and over dinner, we shall talk history.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Hesitantly, Carolyn sat herself down. She <em>was</em> hungry, she
      realised, having subsisted mainly on coffee all day, leavened with a few
      biscuits, as she had tried to help hold the conference together.</p>

    <p>&#8220;As we are talking history,&#8221; Nancy continued, &#8220;I thought we might eat in
      antique style, as the Romans might, both in style and menu. As the daring
      women of the time might have, when dining in purely female company, we shall
      eat reclining, rather than hidden in a corner and seated on uncomfortable
      chairs.</p>

    <p>&#8220;In my future, despite everything that might have severed the chain, we do
      still record our shared history. I am not some figure out of a distant time
      who would, for example, confuse the son of a carpenter nailed to a tree, and
      the son of a carpenter who was first to voyage into space.&#8221;</p>

    <p>A vague and distant memory stirred, and Carolyn saw a chance to correct
      her host.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Carpenter &#8212; he was one of the Americans, wasn't he. The Russians were
      first into space.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;That they were, and Gagarin's father was a carpenter. I hadn't considered
      Scott Carpenter when making my jest. But do let's eat.&#8221; and then to no one in
      particular. &#8220;You may serve.&#8221;</p>

    <p>A low steel table extruded itself from the floor between them, then
      unfolded to reveal the food &#8212; chickpeas and quartered hard-boiled egg; a
      medley of breast of fowl lightly seared and dressed with herbs; shredded
      leeks and peas, all steaming gently, with a chunky white loaf, a bowl of
      olive oil, and a pitcher of wine.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Watered, after the Roman style. And yes, the Romans &#8212; the famous Caesars
      of the early Empire &#8212; are more remote from you than your time is from mine.
      Travel back again as far as I've done, and the Western Empire would still be
      but a memory, while the first tide of Islam would be breaking on Byzantium's
      walls.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Carolyn laid herself down. The savoury smells rising from the table were
      nigh irresistible, but with an effort of will, she served herself only small
      portions to start with, relishing the simply, but exquisitely prepared
      dishes.</p>

    <p>&#8220;History,&#8221; Nancy began, after a few minutes simply dedicated to the meal,
      &#8220;or at least that bit of it we don't share, which is to say all the rest of
      it, from here to eternity. That history is crucial to explaining what it is
      that I am trying to do, is why I brought you here rather than just
      pontificating at you in your flat &#8212; that and not wanting to impose on you for
      a meal you weren't prepared for.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Carolyn swallowed, took a sip of wine, and replied.</p>

    <p>&#8220;It's certainly better than anything I could have put together at short
      notice. Excellent, indeed, and not what I might have first thought of. I
      probably don't want to know how it was prepared. Or, should I say,
      conjured?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;The basic ingredients were produced by matter compiler from the organic
      reserves aboard, and then cooked to order in a conventional fashion by simple
      automation. I think it's great &#8212; one of the benefits from associating with
      the Ascended is being allowed smart matter devices like this.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Sorry, you're losing me again.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Put simply, I'm using a lot of what you might term &#8216;classified&#8217;
      technology which isn't generally available to people in my time. It's yet
      another aspect of the history that separates us. Some of it, I can show you,
      but some of the crucial events, I can only tell.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I don't understand,&#8221; Carolyn confessed. &#8220;If by showing you mean climbing
      aboard your time machine, then isn't it an all or nothing affair? Either you
      can get to future you left, or you've changed the future and you won't be
      able to get to any of it.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;History doesn't work like that &#8212; it's not a river flowing from the
      distant past into the remote future, to be diverted into a different course,
      with a time machine being like a yacht sailing on the river. Instead, all
      possible configurations of the universe are there in the viewpoint of
      eternity, and a history is just a path threaded through that, like the frames
      of a movie. In this hypercosmic film library, all self-consistent stories are
      true, each thread branching at every point.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Rather than moving along a thread, I used a short-cut. The Ascended
      bootstrapped a tunnel by stabilising and stitching together spontaneous
      wormholes from the quantum vacuum, from my time to something as close as
      possible to our past, just after a minor branching that had such a wormhole.
      Now, the two ends of the tunnel move along their own particular histories,
      allowing us to step forward and across all in one.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Carolyn thought for a moment, trying to digest the metaphors into a clear
      understanding.</p>

    <p>&#8220;So if I understand you correctly, we can't get to anywhere between now
      and the thirty-somethingth century, but from there we can what &#8212; do the same
      thing again?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Yes, that's about the size of it. There are other, more controlled
      wormholes there which we will certainly be able to use, and others that I
      hope we shall be permitted. But let us leave weighty matters for discussion
      on a full stomach.&#8221;</p>

    <h1>20:30</h1>

      </div>
    </div>

    <p>&#8220;Dessert?&#8221;</p>

    <p>Carolyn surveyed the clean plate before her, the almost empty serving
      dishes, and contemplated her state of repletion.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Nothing too rich,&#8221; she decided.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Sorbets, to keep in the Roman theme. There'll be coffee to follow, even
      if it is anachronistic. Some things are too necessary and too perfect to
      sacrifice to pedantry.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Carolyn agreed with that sentiment. The sorbets, lemon, mint, and
      something else she couldn't quite identify &#8212; a bit like sour plum and apple &#8212;
      cleared the palate, but still left the need for something by way of a
      digestif.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Again it's anachronistic, but if you want, I can produce something in the
      line of spirits.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;If you can do a decent malt?&#8221; always worth a try, Carolyn thought.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Certainly.&#8221;</p>

    <p>The table folded again, and produced a large cafetiere, a decanter of pale
      amber fluid, cups and glasses, one already containing an oily looking clear
      liquid. Carolyn pulled the stopper from the decanter, and a familiar peaty
      aroma burst forth. She smiled as she poured herself a generous double.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Remembering we both prefer our coffee as it comes.&#8221; Nancy remarked, &#8220;I
      didn't bother with the other traditional impedimenta.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Equipped with coffee and her different liqueur, Nancy rolled on to her
      back, and stared at the ceiling. Carolyn remained propped on one elbow,
      watching her. As she watched, a faint grimace crossed Nancy's face, as if she
      were having to swallow something bitter, and it didn't seem to be either the
      coffee or the spirit.</p>

    <p>&#8220;You saw the comet,&#8221; she began, &#8220;which I'm using for raw materials. By the
      middle of the century such mining &#8212; nearby asteroids, rather than comets &#8212;
      will become economically worthwhile. A mix of politics, technology and sheer
      economic growth.</p>

    <p>&#8220;A generation later, there are whole towns in space &#8212; not just the
      front-line technical staff, but the whole paraphernalia of life. Because they
      are often weeks of travel time from Earth, they have to be highly
      self-sufficient in food, medicine, and even sophisticated manufacture.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Then, not so long after, something long vaguely anticipated, but
      completely unexpected happened. People prophesying it gave it different
      names. At the time, we called it the Event.</p>

    <p>&#8220;It started in Scandinavia, in the small hours, under the midnight sun of
      one high summer. While the first kernel grew, it also launched sparks or
      spores across Europe &#8212; not physical seeds, but logical ones that passed along
      telecoms networks. Those caught hold and themselves grew, and launched their
      own sparks. From there, the change leapt the Atlantic, and towards the Middle
      East.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Nancy waved an arm to the ceiling, and Carolyn followed her gesture.
      There, where there had been an illuminating glow, was a graphic of the globe.
      On the realistic rendering of the Earth, the continents dark green and
      blazing cream, the dark blue-green of ocean. And over it some electric blue
      fire burned.</p>

    <p>&#8220;From the East coast the change leapt across the continent, then down to
      Brazil, and across the Pacific. Finally, less than half an hour after it
      started, it blazed across southern Asia and closed the ring.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Carolyn filled in the sonorous clang that the display and declamation
      demanded. At this point, Nancy paused to take another mouthful of coffee, and
      a draught of the spirit.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Everywhere with a sufficient density of some combination of computation,
      biotech and population &#8212; the intensity in Asia is a result of your
      contribution, or rather a distant consequence of your contribution &#8212; had
      undergone some phase change. Had ascended to some more intense state. But it
      was not yet a sane Utopia. There was war in Heaven, an ultimate clash of
      ideas and ideologies.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Reds and oranges blazed through the blue fire, which burned out into
      darkness in many places around the Earth.</p>

    <p>&#8220;An hour after the Event, or so we later discovered, three billion people
      had been subsumed, almost twice as many annihilated. And across central Asia
      and Africa, where there wasn't the critical density of infrastructure, in the
      industrialised South where there wasn't critical mass of people, or in sparse
      or actively rejectionist enclaves across the West, hundreds of millions were
      left behind.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;From their vantage point in space, my ancestors were watching in horror.
      Most of Earth had fallen silent, though strange lights could be seen in
      places on the night side &#8212; not always where cities had been. Where there were
      remaining islands of technological civilisation &#8212; Australasia and the tip of
      South America in the main &#8212; radio contact continued, but all the launch sites
      had been in areas beyond them to the north, and there was not enough capital
      &#8212; human or financial &#8212; to spare in the enclaves to build new ones.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Return to Earth was possible, but it could only be one-way, and it didn't
      seem to be an attractive proposition.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Times were desperate for all those who had been left behind. All the
      interconnectedness of the world had been torn away. Where industrialisation
      had been introduced essentially within living memory, the veneer fell quickly
      away; where it was entrenched, the halting of flows of trade and the lack of
      some manufacturing facilities brought dislocation. For the moment, collapse
      was halted at a level similar to what you are familiar with, under austere
      emergency governances, but it was clear that within a few years the lack of
      industrial base would tell.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Only the space colonies had any sort of equilibrium, but they had their
      own limits of population and expertise. For some months after the Event, this
      uneasy state persisted.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Then, unlooked for, the Most High emerged from their chrysalis. Through
      their cherubim and seraphim, they could communicate with us, after a fashion.
      They spoke to the space colonies &#8212; that they were prepared to give
      technological assistance and to deliver us those who wanted to join us in
      space.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Most of the survivors were, in effect, being treated as harmless animals,
      and were content to be so. Of the high techs, there were some takers for the
      back to nature option, and some rebels looking to maintain some sort of
      guerilla civilisation, but most signed up for the trip up and out.&#8221;</p>

    <p>The graphics showed a fleet of huge capsules, like a chain of sausages,
      flying from the apex of a great arch that rose from the Pacific, up and out
      to dark rocks, lit by a few faint specks of light.</p>

    <p>&#8220;The gifts that the seraphim gave us were sufficient to establish humanity
      in space &#8212; the space-drive, ectogenesis, adaptive modifications.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Now one of the dark rocks, girdled with chunks of pale ice, was shown
      passing a planet's banded disk, leaving it and a bright star she took to be
      the Sun behind.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Within 150 years of this date, millions of humans, my family amongst
      them, were making their first homes under distant suns, leaving Earth and its
      wounded Ascension, and depleted biosphere behind.&#8221;</p>

    <p>The rock was now shown orbiting a world mainly of whites, with a narrow
      band of cloud obscured ocean green in the tropics.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Humanity was now loose amongst the stars.&#8221;</p>

    <p>The display returned to the same uniform illumination as the rest of the
      ceiling. This was clearly the end of the oration. Nancy replenished her glass
      by some magical sleight of hand, and poured herself some more coffee in
      mundane fashion. Behind her, in the windows lining the lounge the Earth was
      gradually replacing the stars.</p>

    <p>&#8220;So, what is it you want to change?&#8221; Carolyn had heard plenty of
      exposition, but no explanation of the grievance that Nancy wished to
      redress.</p>

    <p>&#8220;All of it. The Ascended of my future want the whole of your species to
      Ascend, and I want to participate in it. To become part of something finer,
      something wonderful, something better than the Ascension I have seen.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Something akin to ecstasy crossed her face as she spoke, maybe even
      religious fanaticism.</p>

    <p>&#8220;And what then?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;The Earth will recover, and other voices will join the Ascension. And we
      shall endure.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Now, shall we go?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;To the future?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Draining her drinks, Nancy sprang to her feet, with more energy than
      Carolyn felt able to muster, replete, and slightly relaxed from the alcohol
      as she was. She rose more slowly to her feet, and followed.</p>

    <p>Nancy led the way to a door on the far side of the lounge. Beyond was
      another of the pale dove grey corridors like those they had followed from the
      car.</p>

    <p>There came, as they walked, the distant sounds of mechanism, and a slight
      feeling of motion. Carolyn looked around, with sudden apprehension.</p>

    <p>Nancy paused, looked distant for a moment, then &#8220;Tantalum sinter billets.
      A recompense for the economic side-effects of providing a protectorate for
      the other terrestrial species who are closer to you genetically than I am.&#8221; A
      graphic appeared on the wall showing a map of the world, with a large part of
      central Africa and sections of the south-east Asian archipelago
      emphasised.</p>

    <p>They went on for some hundreds of yards of featureless way, and then
      Carolyn suddenly felt a sense of lightness. Ahead a the corridor ended in a
      door. Nancy opened it, and held it open for Carolyn to step through.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Welcome to the future.&#8221; she announced.</p>

    <h1>22:30</h1>

    <p>Back at last in her flat, sitting blessedly alone at the little breakfast
      bar that was still cluttered with the remains of breakfast, Carolyn looked at
      her glass.</p>

    <p>Empty.</p>

    <p>She reached over for the bottle, and filled the glass almost to the brim
      with the wine. The bottle was now well over half empty, and she was beginning
      to feel agreeably drunk. At least she still had that consolation.</p>

    <p>She took another mouthful, and looked out at the hateful darkness through
      the window. She had seen so much, so many strange things, that made her own
      endeavours seem futile. What did her struggles mean even over so little a
      span as a couple of centuries, let alone the vistas she had been shown?</p>

    <p>And yet her actions would make a difference in the details of the near
      term; and from now the entire of the future flowed. She had responsibilities
      there. So she had made the necessary phone calls to reschedule tomorrow's
      program at the conference before cracking open the bottle.</p>

    <p>She had made a decision that could possibly be crucial for everyone now
      alive, and could not be sure if it was the right one. The bottle was there to
      numb the doubts and terrors. Soon she would need to sleep, to be ready for
      the morning, and would need to be more relaxed in order to do so.</p>

    <h1>12:00 UTC, 12 May 3342</h1>

    <p>The corridor opened onto a concrete balcony above a dusty road, and facing
      a ragged rust-brown cliff, maybe thirty yards away. Above, covering the area,
      a square-gridded glass roof at some distance above, showed a pale whitish
      sky. Low above the clifftop to the left, shone a Sun that, though too bright
      to look at, some how seemed wrong.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Mars, in my epoch,&#8221; Nancy announced.</p>

    <p>&#8220;We've come through a smaller wormhole that I brought through the major
      warp that the <cite>Secret Rose</cite> is holding open. This end is in the
      neutral territory where the unAscended population of the Partnership worlds
      can communicate with representatives of the Ascended on matters relating to
      Earth. Most importantly, we are in a position where, so long as we stay a
      whole number of days &#8212; you don't want to be jet-lagged when you get home &#8212; we
      can get you back home by bed-time of the evening we just left, by choosing an
      appropriate wormhole path.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Carolyn leant on the edge of the concrete wall edging the balcony, and
      looked over. Beneath, maybe twenty feet below, something looking a bit like a
      skeletal racing car was parked, partly hidden from view underfoot.</p>

    <p>There was a strange, almost metallic, tang in the air.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Are we starting to get to the show, rather than the tell part any time
      soon?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;This is the first bit of show, though perhaps not the most spectacular.
      The overture, perhaps, for a real show that will begin tomorrow after
      breakfast. It's only early evening here, but it will be dark soon enough &#8212;
      it's near the autumn equinox, and we're in the tropics here.</p>

    <p>&#8220;At the moment, we are in the Clan Wolf enclave &#8212; essentially my own
      private estate, as none of my family have been in the Solar System since we
      left with the first wave of starships like I showed you just. It's just a
      roofed over valley &#8212; crude engineering on a world far enough from Earth
      conditions that terraforming would be a multi-kiloyear project.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Worlds much closer to Earth in size can be manipulated more easily, and
      doing so has been a family speciality, so I suppose I'm being a little
      defensive about the quality of the environment here. At least the stink of
      the peroxide sands has just about been dealt with.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Tomorrow we will first meet the Linkers, those post-humans who provide
      the Stargate network &#8212; transient wormholes &#8212; that provides the major arteries
      of interstellar commerce. We need to go through them to get passage to Earth
      approved, but that is just a formality. It's when there that I can't be sure
      exactly what we can get approved.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;So, is there any tourist bit to do here and now?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Not much. Once you've seen one bit of red sand with some marginal
      vegetation, you've seen it all. It's a bit late, body-clock wise, for a
      worthwhile tour of spectacular areology. Most of it is in night at the
      moment, anyway.&#8221; She headed away, along the balcony. Carolyn briefly
      entertained plans to dive back through the door, or off the balcony, but
      dismissed them. She could run, but where to? Achieving what?</p>

    <p>Resignedly, she followed her guide around an angle where the balcony
      followed the course of the valley, to where the way descended in a number of
      short flights of steps.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Going down, it's easier to jump!&#8221; she was directed, and shown by example.
      In the reduced gravity, hopping down half a dozen steps felt strange, but the
      landing could be easily taken in one's stride.</p>

    <p>Catching up, Carolyn asked the question that the last answer in her own
      time prompted.</p>

    <p>&#8220;What about all the people?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;In the areas I've designated ape protectorates? They all died, just like
      the apes, just like you did. I don't think it would come as a shock to you
      that you didn't make it to your eleventy-first birthday.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;That's not what I meant, and you know it.&#8221; Carolyn snapped.</p>

    <p>&#8220;No, but it is true here where we stand. It is why I am doing what I am.
      The people back at the other end of the wormhole are being displaced. For
      many, it is actually being displaced <em>again</em>. There will be
      some violence, some hardships, but many of those people may be salvaged, not
      just the young, lucky and long-lived handful who might have ended up in the
      right foreign country in the right circumstances on the right day.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Again a look of swallowing something bitter crossed her face, draining its
      vitality. Carolyn looked at a woman who was clearly exhausted, showing some
      of the age she claimed.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I don't know how many I can save. But it has to be more than actually
      happened. This is really a second chance for everyone. The Event is already
      out there ahead of you, a tidal wave rising from the depths of the future.
      All I can do is guide it, and hope that it is a kinder and cleaner change.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I have taken it upon myself to try to redeem the most I can of my
      ancestral species. Not all &#8212; I have to weed, to prune, but all that I can. It
      is not as simple as being nailed to a tree, and I have no-one to ask to take
      the burden from me.</p>

    <p>&#8220;In every moment, alternates are exfoliating. Many, maybe most, are going
      to give up. There will be difficult times ahead. As if it were not enough to
      manage all your billions, the human Ascension is not unique; a consensus
      reached in my day might be misunderstood in yours. But I am determined that I
      shall not fall by the wayside.&#8221;</p>

    <p>She turned away, leant on the balcony wall, looking down at the ground
      below. She turned again to Carolyn, looking young, lost.</p>

    <p>&#8220;But I can't do it alone.&#8221;</p>

    <p>There were no artful tears, or trembling of lip, but an expression of
      patent vulnerability.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I don't know what to say,&#8221; Carolyn confessed. &#8220;This is all too much. I'm
      just one person who's been trying to get enough people to listen, so we can
      get a few of the things we in the West take for granted to the most deprived
      people in the world. Things that will improve their economic position, and
      allow them to fend for themselves.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;And some of those things you say you take for granted are things that
      essentially no one had, and definitely no one took for granted, when you were
      a child. And it keeps on like that. Don't forget, I know your whole story, at
      least as it went without my intervention.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;But don't worry, I shall spare you the details. Now, we still have a way
      to go before we can call it a night.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Carolyn checked her watch. It indicated almost half past nine. She was
      tired after a long and stressful day, and generally in a pleasant
      after-dinner state despite the occasional verbal fencing, but the sudden
      burst of daylight and reduced gravity had rather dispelled immediate
      weariness.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Where to?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;A villa, somewhere away from these workshops. We don't need to live over
      the business here, so we don't.&#8221;</p>

    <p>A final cascade of steps, and they were on the valley floor. This, Carolyn
      thought, as she kicked up some of the sand, this is the dust of another
      planet. It didn't look much different from the sands of the Australian red
      centre, or the rose-red sands of Petra.</p>

    <p>Nancy had loped on ahead, turning back under the way they had come to the
      contraption she had seen part of when leaning over the balcony. A large,
      extended chassis with balloon tyres, it was surmounted by a small canopied
      capsule at the front, and various mechanisms around each axle.</p>

    <p>There were a couple of steps to help climbing, and Nancy hopped up them,
      did something to hinge the canopy up, and scrambled into a seat. Carolyn
      followed more cautiously, settling herself into the free seat, and noting
      that there were no obvious controls.</p>

    <p>&#8220;The villa.&#8221; Nancy instructed as one might to a cab driver when she was
      seated. The canopy closed with a gentle, but unmistakeable, thunk. Engines
      purred into life, and the car reversed out from under the balcony before
      starting down the road.</p>

    <p>The ride was smooth, despite the completely unmade surface, with just
      enough bouncing and occasional moments of free-fall as the car ran over
      shallow depressions to reassure Carolyn that this was not just a video
      projection. As they skimmed down the valley, in gathering shadow, she noticed
      patches of grass, an ankle deep carpet thick enough to seem solid green when
      looked aslant, but plainly sparse when looked at from above. Occasional
      glints showed as things moved through the cover. Scattered thinly amongst the
      grass, a few dark low bushes made this look even more like some earthly
      desert fringe.</p>

    <p>Maybe a mile down the valley they came to a barrier. A smooth grey surface
      blocked the entire span from wall to wall, a couple of hundred yards, and up
      to meet the roof. The car rolled to a stop, then crawled forwards into a well
      lit tunnel that opened ahead.</p>

    <p>Another pause before doors opened ahead, and they headed out into the
      open. Carolyn turned around to look back, seeing that they had emerged from a
      great greenhouse-like structure that roofed over the valley.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Nancy confirmed for her, &#8220;we're now out in the real desert. It's
      simpler to keep the wormhole in a shed out of the way where it doesn't
      interfere with any of the other kit we'd want to use. The terrain is
      convenient for the low tech stuff here &#8212; just wall off a section of canyon
      and roof it over.&#8221;</p>

    <p>The car picked up speed now, and soon emerged from the canyon into open
      plain. The setting sun, behind and to the right cast long shadows across the
      boulder-strewn plain that faded into the general dimness as the disk sank
      beneath the horizon. A general haziness above held some light, but the car
      soon switched on powerful beams of its own.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Twilight doesn't last in the tropics even with the high dust haze instead
      of cloud. All that really does is ruin the seeing. If you'd rather doze, we
      can kill the lights &#8212; they're just for our benefit; the automation uses IR
      sensors. You'll not be missing much &#8212; it's just desert like this for a while
      now.&#8221;</p>

    <p>The chair was comfortable, and reclined at enough of an angle that she
      wouldn't have to worry about waking as her head lolled forwards.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Sounds good to me. Wake me when we get there.&#8221;</p>

    <p>She settled back, and Nancy ordered the lights off. Not quite dark
      enfolded them, and she let the gentle motion of the ride rock her to
      sleep.</p>

    <h1>13:15 UTC, 12 May 3342</h1>

    <p>After some time of dozing, Carolyn woke to a change in the background
      environment. They had come to a halt in the middle of an open and dark plain.
      Above, the stars blazed, casting just enough light to distinguish ground from
      sky.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I'm sorry to have woken you, but there's something to see. We're about
      half-way to the villa, but we're now above the dust and haze. There's still a
      hint of sunset in the west, and if you look up from there, you can see a
      couple of bright stars, about twice as far apart as a full moon. Venus is the
      white one to the right, and the Earth is the bluish one, with the Moon just
      above it.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;And the other bright ones up there?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Jupiter and Regulus. And all the way up, that's Deimos at the end of the
      orbital tether. We'll be heading there tomorrow. Orion is just setting
      there.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Why aren't we just heading up there now in your whizzy space car?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Because here I am a guest, and have to follow the rules. Everything
      within 2 AU of the Sun is managed by agents of the Ascension. A few of us
      lesser beings are allowed access, but we're not the free agents we'd be in
      our home environments.</p>

    <p>&#8220;In particular, one of the rules is that flight plans to orbit need prior
      approval, and it's just easier to take the lift, which we'll do tomorrow in
      the wee small hours local time.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Might as well settle down again. We've a way to go yet, and there's
      nothing else different to see until we get where we're going.&#8221;</p>

    <h1>14:00 UTC, 12 May 3342</h1>

    <p>Carolyn had not settled down to doze again, but had just lain there
      staring at the bright dusting of stars above. That little blue spark, setting
      over the dark desert, was her own home, seen as no one in her day had ever
      seen it with their own naked eyes.</p>

    <p>Could she really have a hand in its fate? Did she dare? Was this plan a
      good thing or a mad one? Things beyond the scope of just the simple aid and
      assistance she had been working for frightened her. Who was she to decide the
      fate of billions?</p>

    <p>For the moment, she could do nothing but wait, and go along with the ride.
      Time for decisions &#8212; hard decisions &#8212; would come later, when she got back
      home, if she ever did, but she could not cease to wrestle with the issues. If
      only when she woke it could be with nothing more than a simple development
      conference to deal with!</p>

    <p>Her dark spiralling thoughts chasing around in tight circles were
      interrupted by Nancy's sudden cry &#8220;We're here!&#8221;</p>

    <p>She sat up, but could see nothing in the dark; and then she realised that
      the dark was what there was to see. Something vast loomed ahead, blotting out
      the stars. And suddenly light blazed out from the obscurity, showing the
      facade of a building in classical style carved into a soaring cliff face that
      rose up above the range of the light into the gloom, far, far above.</p>

    <p>The car rolled forwards into the gaping doorway, where the titanic doors
      opened for them, and into a much smaller tunnel where it halted.</p>

    <p>&#8220;All change!&#8221; Nancy announced, as the canopy opened.</p>

    <p>Carolyn waited until Nancy had hopped down before scrambling out after
      her, and following, emerged into a vast dimly lit atrium decorated in a style
      that seemed to fuse classical and ancient Egyptian. Classically draped
      caryatids with wolves' heads towered up to frame the human-scale doorways to
      left and right between their calves, and ahead, the larger way came barely
      past waist height. In the gloom beyond, Carolyn could discern two files of
      similar figures in a cathedral-like space.</p>

    <p>Such lighting as there was came from many faint sources casting light
      upwards onto the walls, arranged in strips maybe ten feet apart up the walls,
      the highest casting light up onto the muzzles of the statues, leaving all
      above in obscurity.</p>

    <p>&#8220;It's all for show, really,&#8221; Nancy explained, &#8220;There have to be a number
      of purely functional areas &#8212; life support, power, that sort of thing, so I
      just let my imagination run riot designing them. Living quarters are
      upstairs.&#8221;</p>

    <p>She led the way to the opening on the left, stepped in and jumped up,
      being suddenly whisked out of sight.</p>

    <p>Carolyn walked to the doorway, and peered cautiously upwards. There was a
      light a long way above.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Just jump, and the lift will take you!&#8221; the voice echoed from above.</p>

    <p>Gingerly, Carolyn stepped into the darkness. It looked just like a bare
      shaft. Nothing happened as she stood there, then cautiously she hopped.</p>

    <p>All of a sudden it was like being a cork floating in a tube that was
      filling with water, and she rose rapidly towards the light. Just as she was
      about to curl up against imminently slamming into the roof, she stopped,
      floating in mid air by another doorway, where Nancy stood.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Walk towards me,&#8221; she instructed.</p>

    <p>It was like the walking on air over the Thames, that now seemed so long
      ago, like walking across a firmly sprung mattress, until she stood on solid
      flooring again.</p>

    <p>At once she noticed the warmth. When they had opened the car, the little
      pocket of warmth they had built up had dissipated into an almost inevitable
      seeming cool, verging on the chill. Here, it was warm and even cosy, despite
      being another large room, though with a ceiling at a more human scale &#8212; a
      yard perhaps beyond where she reckoned she could reach, but extending enough
      that it seemed oppressively low at the far end.</p>

    <p>To the right, the wall was black, slightly glossy, enough to act as a
      faint mirror &#8212; a picture window, she guessed. Opposite, the other long wall
      was a mural that she thought looked a bit like bad barbarian sci-fi cover art
      &#8212; a group of leather clad warrior women on horseback riding out of long green
      grass into a retro-style Martian landscape that could have been Burroughs or
      Bradbury. At least the leather outfits were practical chaps and jerkins
      rather than the more usual run of skin-tight fetish gear seen on book
      covers.</p>

    <p>&#8220;A nostalgic conceit of mine,&#8221; Nancy confessed. &#8220;This is a copy of a mural
      I found in the rooms I took for my own at home as a teen.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Back then, I doubt if I knew that Mars even existed, and certainly never
      thought I'd end up there, here. Coming here, I encountered a fair bit of the
      legends that the place gathered, especially in the century or so before your
      time, and suddenly I knew what that picture had been about. It seemed the
      right thing to do, juxtapose it with a view of the real thing.</p>

    <p>&#8220;But it's late, and you'll want to sleep. Just choose one of the beds.&#8221;
      Carolyn had noticed the random assortment of furnishings, including chairs of
      all kinds, tables, desks, and shelves full of all sorts of bric-a-brac.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Kitchen is up the far end, for breakfast tomorrow, bathroom is this side&#8221;
      &#8212; she waved to the right &#8212; &#8220;and I've duplicated toothbrush and stuff for
      you. Simpler than explaining the modern stuff.</p>

    <p>&#8220;It's about midnight your time, so I'll set a wake-up for eight hours from
      now?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Sure. Whatever. I'll take that one.&#8221; Carolyn pointed at the nearest
      bed.</p>

    <p>&#8220;OK. Lights down.&#8221; The lighting dropped to two patches of light around two
      of the beds, and a subdued level in the bathroom. &#8220;And key Carolyn's voice
      for her light. So now you just have to tell the lights to switch off.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Great. I'll take the bathroom first if you don't mind.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Sure thing. Anything for a night cap?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;No, I'll be fine.&#8221;</p>

    <p>The bathroom was again reassuringly similar to a hotel bathroom, apart
      from the fact that there were no doors. Fortunately, around the corner and
      out of immediate sight, the expected facilities &#8212; no strange space plumbing &#8212;
      for which Carolyn was grateful. It was a much needed comfort break, and
      discreetly silent, after the long ride after dinner. The familiar routine of
      washing, and brushing her teeth made it feel almost normal to be here. Only
      the feeling of levity, the strange sluggishness of pouring water reminded her
      that it was not just another random modern hotel in another foreign city,
      probably American, from the size and the vast sunken bath.</p>

    <p>When she returned to the main room, clothes in partial disarray, she was
      intending to modestly climb into bed before undressing. Just outside the pool
      of light by the further bed, however, Nancy was doing something that looked
      like Tai Chi, naked, her back turned.</p>

    <p><strong class="telepathy">Don't mind me</strong> Nancy didn't speak, didn't interrupt her
      tempo, but Carolyn felt the meaning in her head, with a slow serenity that
      overcame the feeling almost of violation. But then hadn't she been told that
      Nancy had been reading her mind? Was it not possible, even obvious, that she
      could probably project thoughts as well? <strong class="telepathy">Just get into bed as you
        wish. No need for shyness.</strong></p>

    <p>Oh, well, when in Rome, Carolyn thought. She left Nancy to her exercises,
      turned her back on her, and undressed. Bed was very welcoming, the sheets
      crisp and cool, with the great bulky quilt that draped to the floor on all
      sides so light in the local gravity.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Lights off,&#8221; she remembered. The lights snapped off. From where she was,
      she could still see part way into the bathroom, where a faint glow gathered
      around every sharp corner, like a negative of a line drawn sketch, and on the
      other side, Nancy, deeply immersed in her exercises, in a dim pool of light.
      Carolyn watched the gracefully moving figure, a hard athlete's body
      reminiscent of the Soviet gymnasts of her youth, for a little while, before
      rolling over, closing her eyes and seeking sleep.</p>

    <p>The second wakening, the feeling of not quite floating, the simple rush of
      wonders made sleep more elusive, however. She tossed and turned a while,
      before lying there staring at the ceiling. The light had dimmed further, but
      there were still the occasional sounds of movement.</p>

    <p>She could not settle the whirl of thoughts in her head. While she could
      put worries about her conference out of her mind for the moment, she had a
      new set of worries. Hijacked into the future, shown wonders, faced with a new
      awesome responsibility for the future of her planet, by this otherwise very
      reasonable person who seemed to be following a single minded Nietzschean
      agenda of her own.</p>

    <p>While she wrestled with anxiety about the future, the light dimmed
      further, until darker than she was used to due to streetlights, and soon a
      rustling of bedclothes, and then quiet but for the distant sounds of
      breathing.</p>
