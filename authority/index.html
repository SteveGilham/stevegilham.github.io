    <h1>Castles in the Sky</h1>

  <div id="content">
    <p>A work in progress. On one level <cite>Castles in the Sky</cite> is a
      consideration of the issues raised by the Singularity; on another it is a
      work of fan-fic along the lines of &#8220;whatever happened
      to&#8230;&#8221; applied to the young heroine of a couple of childrens'
      fantasy stories for which the author has admitted that there was a third
      story, but that he cannot now write it &#8212; here names have been changed
      to protect both the innocent and the guilty. A third strand is to pick up on
      the hints in my annotations of <a href="../MovingDay/index.html">my last long
        fiction</a> &#8212; reworking the future history and building on the <a
        href="../MovingDay/driftmind.html#authority">fragment</a> I quoted, recycling
      the previously developed main character, and an alternate existance of <a href="../rpgs/champions.html">a
        superhero RPG feminist separatist martial
        artist</a>.</p>

    <p>What wasn't intended, but has just happened, is that this has meant that
      all the major characters are women.</p>

    <p>There is occasional strong language. There is a little sanitized violence.
      Two characters have same-sex preference, but there are no explicit passages
      or even public displays of affection that would shift it into the
      <em>shoujo-ai</em> bracket. (I don't feel inclined to add to the pool of
      mediocre smut on line. The rest of the internet
      is there if that's what you're after - just filter to your own kink.
      Alternatively, as <cite>the Stranglers</cite> put it, &#8220;use your
      twentieth century imagination, if you've got any, that is.&#8221;.) The main
      challenges are clashes of philosophy. Would probably get a 15 certificate
      were it a film.

        about half finished, when I really have stalled hard. The main characters
        are pulling in directions I hadn't anticipated. Maybe I'll revisit it
        later. There needs to be about one more chapter after this.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Alternate Endings</h2>

    <p>Not alternate endings starting from a point partway through the tale
      above, but, as Nancy Wolf is seeking in her own way to imminentize the
      Eschaton &#8212; bring about the End of the World &#8212; this is a place
      where I can put implicit alternatives to the whole, where she gets involved
      in other such final events. Nancy's journey through time is a matter of
      manipulating the quantum foam, to reach a configuration something like her
      past. As such, her destination suffers a degree of uncertainty. With low, but
      non-zero, probability her world line could be directed anywhere, and under
      the Many Worlds model that I'm using for her cosmos, if so, it is.</p>

      <li><a href="eva.html" accesskey="A" title="access key Alt-A">Redemption-E</a> &#8212; <cite>Neon Genesis
          Evangelion</cite> : arrival 2015, as the 15<sup>th</sup> Angel attacks
        Tokyo-3. In a few places, in making references to Angels, this presumes
        the slant on the nomenclature in the English translation. Not a happy
        ending &#8212; <cite>Evangelion</cite> doesn't <em>do</em> happy
        endings. About as long as the missing chapter and a half from the above.
        *sigh*</li>
