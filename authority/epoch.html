    <h1>03:00</h1>

    <p>The blaring of a phone brutally penetrated layers of sleep. Celia Thompson
      snapped awake.</p>

    <p>Not just any phone, but <em>the</em> phone &#8212; one she had programmed with the most
      annoying tone she could find, an accordion-style rendition of <cite>Bobby
        Shaftoe</cite>, guaranteeing her immediate attention. Somewhere, one of her
      monitors had detected an intrusion, and was dialling out for her most urgent
      attention.</p>

    <p>Only one quarter awake, she scrambled out of bed, dislodging an indignant
      cat, and staggered across the darkened room towards the glow of status lights
      and the faint phosphorescence of darkened screens from the desk by the
      window. By that faint light, she located the phone and triggered the caller
      ID. The number showed almost blinding bright on the LCD display as it sprang
      into life, burning the number into her consciousness. Not a wrong number, but
      as anticipated, an all too right one.</p>

    <p>Knowing that the call would be on automatic, she accepted it and dropped
      it again immediately, and checked her mail-box. The expected text message had already
      arrived &#8212; confirming the site name, <cite>ArchiTechnix International</cite>,
      and the notation <code>proc++</code>.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Shit!&#8221; Someone had managed to get into one of the company sites in the
      Cambridge Silicon Fen area she stood as network security consultant for, and
      was busy stealing at least currently idle CPU. There was no overt sign of
      data theft or tampering, at least as far as an automated process could tell,
      but that wasn't that much.</p>

    <p>But why ArchiTechnix of all those she had responsibility for? Most of the
      small outfits she dealt with, smart new start-ups run by young lads with
      bright ideas and a bunch of capital, often unsure of how to deal with women,
      let alone ones who were both techies and nearly old enough to be their
      mother. ArchiTechnix was, by contrast, an old established outfit &#8212; old enough
      to have been in graceful decline for the best part of a decade, and run by
      people more of her own age, many of them in fact college contemporaries of
      hers. That fitted with the lack of obvious data theft &#8212; no real market-making
      data to be found there unless things had changed without her getting any
      inkling &#8212; but on the same count, not the most obvious place to steal cycles
      from.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Hmm.&#8221; This was clearly going to take some time.</p>

    <p>Leaving her diagnostic PC to boot up, she felt around by the bed for
      clothes, finding a sweatshirt which she struggled in to. The wee small hours
      of an autumn morning were, after all, not the best time to spend a long time
      working
      <!--[if

title="Naked In Front Of the Computer">NIFOC</acronym><![endif]--><!--[if 
!IE]> <--><abbr title="Naked In Front Of the Computer">NIFOC</abbr><!--> 
<![endif]-->, and if the intrusion was simply a grab for distributed
      processing power, rather than data, time was unlikely to be of the
      essence.
    </p>

    <p>Returning to the keyboard, she fired up a
      <code><!--[if 
IE]><acronym 
title="secure shell">ssh</acronym><![endif]--><!--[if 
!IE]> <--><abbr 
title="secure shell">ssh</abbr><!--> 
<![endif]--></code>
      login and a packet
      sniffer, and dialled out to the somewhat obsolete PC acting as her monitoring
      host in the
      <!--[if 
IE]><acronym 
title="De-Militarized Zone">DMZ</acronym><![endif]--><!--[if 
!IE]> <--><abbr title="De-Militarized Zone">DMZ</abbr><!--> 
<![endif]-->
      of the affected site. As the login prompt came sluggishly up,
      she tapped impatiently on the desk with the rim of the old silver bracelet
      she wore constantly.
    </p>

    <p>With the connection sitting there and waiting, she looked at the packet
      trace &#8212; the site had correctly accepted her home-brew, and highly paranoid,
      crypto suite &#8212; 509-bit elliptic curve and
      triple-<!--[if 
IE]><acronym 
title="Advanced Encryption System">AES</acronym><![endif]--><!--[if 
!IE]> <--><abbr title="Advanced Encryption System">AES</abbr><!--> 
<![endif]-->
      &#8212; and each end had
      authenticated itself. Given that the private key that had signed both the
      certificates, that had now passed muster, lived only on a single, securely
      stored,
      <!--[if 
IE]><acronym 
title="Compact Disk, Recordable">CD-R</acronym><![endif]--><!--[if 
!IE]> <--><abbr title="Compact Disk, Recordable">CD-R</abbr><!--> 
<![endif]-->,
      she was at least happy with the text communications. Now, she
      could fire up a generic secured proxy, and run a remote desktop server
      through it.
    </p>

    <p>With equal paranoia, she started up a web browser, typed in the effective
      <!--[if 
IE]><acronym 
title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</acronym><![endif]--><!--[if 
!IE]> <--><abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr><!--> 
<![endif]-->
      of the proxied desktop, and watched that link being set up. That too
      passed its mutual authentication, and a proper login screen appeared in the
      browser window. So, now she was able to work in a civilised fashion, what
      else could she trust?
    </p>

    <p>At least the logs for the data that had provoked the alert seemed not to
      have been significantly altered, if at all. Examining them, she found some
      evidence that hadn't been concealed; a high
      <!--[if 
IE]><acronym 
title="Central Processor Unit">CPU</acronym><![endif]--><!--[if 
!IE]> <--><abbr title="Central Processor Unit">CPU</abbr><!--> 
<![endif]-->,

      load process called
      <code>optimad</code> running on the main outward-facing server. Noting the amount
      of processor time it had used, at nearly 100%, she had an approximate time by
      which the break-in had occurred.
    </p>

    <p>Network logs next &#8212; and these too showed no signs of any attempt to cover
      tracks. At about the estimated time, there had been a connection to the mail
      server process and, after a few brief exchanges, a large bundle of data had
      been sent down the wire. The connection had been from a host which a reverse
      <!--[if 
IE]><acronym 
title="Domain Name Service">DNS</acronym><![endif]--><!--[if 
!IE]> <--><abbr title="Domain Name Service">DNS</abbr><!--> 
<![endif]-->,
      showed to operate from a Tajikistan domain name &#8212; some academic sounding
      place according to the registrar records, left over from Soviet days, she
      presumed, and definitely not just a vanity name chosen for the happenstance
      of a double meaning for the <acronym title="International Standards Organisation">ISO</acronym> country code,
      like most supposed <span title="ISO code: tm">Turkmenistan</span>
      or <span title="ISO code: md">Moldovan</span> domains.
    </p>

    <p>Following a hunch, she launched a few connections to the offending Tajik
      address, and probed their response. As she had expected, it was operating a
      number of unguarded proxy processes &#8212; anyone in the world knowing about that
      host could have relayed the attack through. She knew of several web sites
      hosted in various out-of-the-way locations which published just such
      information for interested parties to exploit &#8212; indeed, had used such
      information herself at times to tunnel out though corporate firewalls via
      proxy chains operating on high port numbers or to addresses that were not
      blocked by policy. Whether this site was on any of the lists she knew of, she
      didn't know, but there were likely to be enough clandestine exchanges of such
      information that it could be anyone.</p>

    <p>More out of routine than in the expectation of any result, she sent off a
      bunch of pro-forma notifications, and requests for network log data about the
      time of the attack &#8212; if they kept them in Tajikistan, if that was where the
      server really was &#8212; <code>cc</code>'d to the main connectivity providers along
      the route. So much for the easy bit . Now to the real work &#8212; ending the
      theft, and auditing for damage.</p>

    <p>She sat back in her chair, stretched, then wiggled her feet around to find
      her slippers, before she let her feet get any colder than they now were. As
      if realising from this that she wasn't going to be coming back to bed in a
      hurry, a furry, purry, and very sharp bundle chose that point to land on her
      lap, latching claws into her bare thighs to avoid sliding off, and
      positioning itself to be in the way of the keyboard.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Ow! Oh, Lumpuscat, please, not now, I'm busy.&#8221; Carefully lifting the cat
      from her lap, she cuddled him briefly, being rewarded by purring and a little
      struggle, before getting up and carrying him out of the bedroom, and shutting
      the door. Outside there were a few squeaks of protest and half-hearted
      scrabbling to get back in, but she ignored it, and eventually silence resumed
      as the cat stalked off in disgust.</p>

    <p>Getting back to the computer, she scrolled to the more recent logs, and
      found more suspicious network activity, outbound, to addresses which she
      quickly verified were also acting as proxies, small packets of entirely
      random seeming binary data &#8212; without even the consistent headers that marked
      well known cryptographic protocols where the rest of data would be expected
      to look random. It was looking more and more like a rogue distributed
      processor of some sort &#8212; but for what purpose? She doubted she would be able
      find out.</p>

    <p>&#8220;OK, you bastard, time's up!&#8221; She logged in as sysadmin to the mail server
      desktop, and selecting the rogue task, sent it a kill command. The process
      continued to eat up CPU, although politely deferring to her own use; and
      responded with message stating that the signal had been ignored. A second
      attempt was no more successful.</p>

    <p>This was going to be difficult. Perhaps a reboot would clear it. If not,
      then she'd need to find out if it had hidden itself in the various start-up
      procedures.</p>

    <p>It didn't &#8212; reboot that is. The request was handled just as the direct
      kill &#8212; the task was busy, and would not go away. It was time to get personal.
      She picked up the phone, and dialled.</p>

    <p>After a while, a sleepy voice answered. As soon as she heard the response
      and was happy that there was intelligent life at the other end of the line,
      she began:</p>

    <p>&#8220;Martyn? This is Celia. We've had an intrusion, and I need to go and take
      your external server down to clear it. I thought I'd better let you know
      before going and physically dropping the company off the 'net for a
      while.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Well, just reboot it and we can talk it over in the morning.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I've tried that, but it's not having any of it. I'm going to have to
      switch it off mechanically &#8212; pulling cables out if need be.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Christ! I'll see you there just as soon as I can.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Celia put down the phone. At least someone else was sharing the grief now
      &#8212; and as Technical Director, Martyn Willard was best placed to make some of
      the difficult commercial decisions that might need to be made.</p>

    <p>She closed down the connections, and set her computers to stand-by.
      Getting up from her chair, she began to dress rather more presentably,
      discarding the sweatshirt she had grabbed for immediate insulation in favour
      of the one she considered her working uniform &#8212; black with the word
      <code class="stencil">SECURITY</code> in military stencil font across the shoulder-blades.
    </p>

    <p>Getting ready took longer than she had wanted &#8212; cats demanding to be fed,
      then duplicate offsite CD-Rs of security checksums, and a separate portable
      with an fresh and impeccably clean operating system installation, and disks
      for a complete re-build of the server installation all to be bundled
      together, before she could finally leave the house.</p>

    <p>Although there were no nearby streetlights in the close where she lived,
      Cambridge only a few miles distant left a ruddy glow all over the eastern
      horizon, enough to assist her way to the car even on a dark night. That
      night, above the worst of the glow, there was also a bright waning half-moon
      amongst scattered cloud, giving enough light to comfortably see by, and a
      bright planet visible through another break in the clouds, and&#8230;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Oh, fuck!&#8221;</p>

    <p>Drifting against the sky, and against the clouds, a bright ellipse &#8212; or
      perhaps a ring, seen askew &#8212; had appeared from behind one of the patches of
      cloud. It was maybe half the size of the disk of the Moon, and seemed to be
      tumbling slowly as it drifted slowly into the east, reinforcing the
      impression of being a ring of light. It didn't look like an aircraft or even
      a blimp and had no appearance of running lights. It was high up, and there
      was no sound and it had to be huge.</p>

    <p>&#8220;If that's out in space,&#8221; she thought to herself, &#8220;there's no time to send
      Bruce Willis up to deal with it. Please let it not hit.&#8221;</p>

    <p>She got into the car, and started the engine, tuning the radio to find a
      news program. For the moment, she would pretend that life would go on,
      fighting the shock that had brought her out into a cold sweat and was making
      her movements clumsy, as she steered erratically out onto the main road.</p>

    <h1>06:00</h1>

    <p>In the kitchenette of her King's Cross flat, Carolyn Wilson, still
      half-asleep at this unaccustomed early hour switched on the espresso machine
      for much needed caffeine, and the radio for news. A sense of excitement that
      was half panic filled her &#8212; today was the first day of the development
      conference <cite>Micro-service &#8212; bringing the Grameen model to energy and
        information</cite> that she had been preparing and driving for nearly a year.
      Soon, she would need to leave, to catch the Tube to Heathrow to meet the head
      of the World Bank, who would be making the opening address as part of a
      stop-over between a visit to Moscow and his return to Washington</p>

    <p>Her focus was abruptly brought back to the present by the voice on the
      radio. Not the expected closing moments of the bucolic Farming Today, but the
      avuncular tones of John Humphrys from the <cite>Today programme</cite>:</p>

    <p>&#8220;For those of you expecting <cite>Farming Today</cite>, we apologise. Today's edition
      is being broadcast only on long wave, while here on Radio 4 FM, we are
      carrying a special extended programme, covering last night's special and
      unexpected events. News headlines after the time signal.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Another 9&#8211;11 style terrorist outrage? The Queen dead? she wondered briefly, while the
      pips sounded; then &#8220;This is the Today Programme with John Humphrys, and James
      Naughtie at Westminster. Today's main headline.</p>

    <p>&#8220;For ages Man has asked &#8216;<em>Are we alone in the universe?</em>&#8217;. Today that
      question has been dramatically answered.</p>

    <p>&#8220;A vast construction, not built by Earthly hands, is in orbit above us,
      while governments and the UN attempt to communicate with it. The entire
      programme will be devoted to these events. But first, in other news&#8230;&#8221;</p>

    <p>and he turned to the normal run of stories of political in-fighting in
      Westminster, and various paramilitary activities around the world that would
      normally have filled the programme, disposing of them in a couple of
      minutes.</p>

    <p>Carolyn sat there, drawn in to the sheer incredibility of what she had
      heard, leaving her coffee untouched. The radio continued,</p>

    <p>&#8220;We now go over to our Westminster studio, where the Foreign Secretary is
      waiting to make a statement.&#8221;</p>

    <p>It sounded like a long-prepared speech, written as a template, and hastily
      rewritten to meet actual events. Even the presenter's unwonted deference
      didn't help the nervous delivery.</p>

    <p>&#8220;&#8230;RAF officials are following guidelines set forth for this eventuality,
      and are in communication both with American Government teams and the UN
      Secretariat. We are still working to achieve some common language with which
      to communicate with the visitors&#8230;&#8221;</p>

    <p>And then another signal broke in, screeching at first, before stabilising.
      A woman's strangely accented voice muttered &#8220;Got it.&#8221; There was a deep
      breath, then:</p>

    <p>&#8220;People of Earth, rejoice! The future will be better this time!</p>

    <p>&#8220;I come from the future of yesterday to help perfect Earth's crippled
      Ascension. These words, now broadcast on all channels and translated where
      necessary into their usual languages, these are words your governances did
      not wish you to hear, which have not been broadcast as I had requested.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Although I was not born on Earth, I am of human descent, and so this
      planet's future, which could have been my past, concerns me. This time,
      Earth's Ascension must be complete, without leaving anyone marooned.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Certain completely dysfunctional governances have been already deleted;
      others have received warnings. All should know that ballistic missiles are
      now an obsolete technology, as a surprising number of forces have found out.
      Those receiving video transmissions can see the collection of warheads I have
      retrieved.&#8221;</p>

    <p>There was a pause, presumably while pictures were shown, then:</p>

    <p>&#8220;There will be no tolerance of exploitative or selfish behaviour on the
      part of autocrats or oligarchs of any kind; and in all things, certain
      minimum levels of civilised standards of behaviour must be observed as part
      of building a unanimous Ascension.</p>

    <p>&#8220;People! remember! inherently exploitative governances are not civilised.
      If your governors do not now heed this warning, they will not be
      tolerated.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Meanwhile, engineering and education will commence. There will be
      landings where there is a need for surface-based installations. Data are
      being made available on the Internet, at sites which are honouring the domain
      <code>www.ascension.int</code>&#8221; she pronounced the usual stumbling block at the
      start of the hostname as wuh-wuh-wuh &#8220;Initial downloads contain earthquake
      data for the next decade which should be fairly reliable, many significant
      genome sequences with their associated histones, proteomes and polymorphisms,
      along with construction data for improved portable power storage and
      generation.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;These will be freely available to all. There will be more such data made
      available as time passes, but eventually the final process of the Ascension
      will all be up to you.</p>

    <p>&#8220;In the interim, I shall be watching over all of you. Good luck, and don't
      leave anyone behind this time &#8212; and that includes me. I shall now return you
      to the normal programming on your wavelength.&#8221;</p>

    <p>There was a pause, and then John Humphrys returned, apologising for the
      interruption of the transmission, and repeating the headline of contact from
      space.</p>

    <p>The interrupted interview with the Foreign Secretary was not resumed.
      Instead, the program moved on, following the promise of an interview with
      Stephen Hawking, to a discussion item, where the usual run of pundits were
      ousted by a panel comprising a LibDem politician who Carolyn recalled had
      been pushing for spending on a defence against asteroids, a couple of science
      fiction authors, and a NASA scientist who seemed to have been chosen for
      being British by birth.</p>

    <p>Gulping down the neglected coffee, she pulled on a coat, grabbed her
      handbag, and headed out to catch the Tube.</p>

    <p>Outside, a normal seeming morning; people already beginning to make their
      journeys to work in the autumnal pre-dawn gloom. It was as if the world
      presented through the radio were just some surreal irrelevance; another era's
      remake of Orson Welles' Martians. But as she approached the Tube station
      entrance, the other media conspired with it. Newsagents placards displayed
      <cite>UFO in orbit &#8212; Official</cite> headlines.
    </p>

    <p>With a sense of inevitability, she stopped at the paper stall near the
      station, picking up an <cite>Express</cite> &#8212; the tabloid size a more
      convenient format than her usual <cite>Guardian</cite> for reading on the
      train. The headline <cite>Heaven Sent?</cite> decorated a picture of a ring
      of light, like a discarded halo, on a starry background.</p>

    <p>She shivered as she descended into the Underground.</p>

    <h1>08:00</h1>

    <p>Three weary figures sat hunched around the server room at ArchiTechnix,
      surrounded by the empty cans of <cite>Jolt</cite> and <cite>Dr. Pepper</cite>
      which had been powering them through the watches of the night. Full daylight,
      however cloudy, now shone through the gaps around where the air conditioning
      plumbing passed through the insulation board over the windows and ran
      eventually to an external cooling unit.</p>

    <p>When, several draining hours before, she had arrived, she had &#8212; despite
      the time taken to assemble all her kit and longer drive &#8212; beaten Martyn to
      the office, and had had to wait in the deserted car-park. The drive had been
      stressful from the need to avoid the natural lure of sleep, but also
      fascinating. with the usually busy streets almost deserted &#8212; a couple of
      cars, a Post Office delivery van, one milk float, and, while she was driving
      down the Backs, a fox.</p>

    <p>By the time Martyn eventually did arrive, with the keys to the office and
      the combination of the alarm system, and they had together lugged the
      equipment up to the second and topmost floor, the surreal dreamy peace that
      the early morning drive had brought her had vanished in mounting
      impatience.</p>

    <p>With her working frame of mind now fully engaged, she had diverted only to
      grab a couple of cans of <cite>Dr. Pepper</cite> before heading in to the
      server room where Martyn was already starting to set up the kit she had
      brought.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Don't plug anything in yet!&#8221; she had needed to warn &#8212; no point in
      dragging clean equipment over, just to have it compromised &#8212; or at least to
      have it compromised without seeing how the attack progressed.</p>

    <p>&#8220;First,&#8221; a pause as she had opened the first can, and taken a very welcome
      gulp of sugar and caffeine, &#8220;we see how things stand at the moment.&#8221;</p>

    <p>And she had proceeded to demonstrate that the touch of fingers on the
      directly attached keyboard had no more effect than her remote attempts to
      cleanly reboot the system. At that point, where the company's web server was
      at stake, he had called in their sysadmin to handle the general system
      administration tasks which were not strictly security issues, while she had
      been free to begin preparations for the worst.</p>

    <p>When he had turned up, Jon, ArchiTechnix's rather archetypal sysadmin had
      &#8212; perhaps unfortunately &#8212; chosen his favourite T-shirt; merchandise
      associated with the old film, <cite>the Forbin Project</cite>, showing a very
      '50s computer bank, and a young white-coated engineer holding a disconnected
      power plug, and bewailing &#8220;&#8230;but it still hasn't stopped!&#8221; On seeing this,
      she had hoped that it would not be prophetic, and had said as much.</p>

    <p>Jon, it had been then, who had actually pressed the reset button, to no
      effect. The power button was equally ineffectual.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Bloody software switches,&#8221; he had mumbled, before finally reaching for
      the wall socket, and switching it off there. The lights in the server stayed
      on for just long enough for pulses to begin to race, but had faded as the
      capacitors had discharged.</p>

    <p>In the sudden silence, deep breaths had been drawn.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Let's power her back up &#8212; it's the middle of the day where our customers
      are.&#8221; Martyn was, as ever, keeping an eye on the company's bottom line.</p>

    <p>So they had done so; and after the usual complaints from the boot sequence
      about disks not cleanly dismounted, the server had sprung back to life. And
      so had <code>optimad</code>.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Now what? &#8221; Martyn had asked.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Two choices.&#8221; Celia had now felt able to reclaim the initiative. &#8220;We drop
      off the net while we bring a new server up, or we let the attacker have his
      way. The amount of traffic it's causing is too low for it to be any sort of
      distributed denial of service, nor are the packets going anywhere famous, or
      even consistent. Doesn't have the feel of a script kiddie, either.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;On the other hand, this does look like a serious new attack, so we might
      just as well try isolating ourselves while the big boys get involved, rather
      than trying to unravel it ourselves. Like what happened when the original
      Internet Worm was on the rampage; though even then sites that stayed
      connected got updates sooner.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Jon?&#8221; Martyn had turned to his usual oracle for answers to do with the
      network.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Dropping the e-mail server for a few hours, until UK business hours,
      would be harmless; the messages will simply be building up on the ISP's
      server, and be ready and waiting for later collection, and no one will be
      expecting a reply until then. It would halt the mailing list and the locally
      hosted parts of the web-site with the on-line ordering. I'd rather hot-swap
      in a minimal server that would present a place-holder front page, and
      sacrifice the mailing list.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;We can scrub one of the Windows beta machines, put up a quick and dirty
      server that just spits back a canned response. Martyn, could you put together
      a form of words. I'll get the machine ready and hack out a server that should
      be too dumb to subvert.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;OK, Jon.&#8221; she had replied. &#8220;I'll take down the mail server &#8212; if I can,
      then try to audit the damage.&#8221;</p>

    <p>And she had pulled up a list of processes, ready to follow anything
      untoward happening with that &#8212; where she had spotted something.</p>

    <p>&#8220;It's gone!&#8221; the rogue process had vanished from the list, and CPU usage
      was at its normal low level. Things were feeling reassuringly normal as she
      closed the mail server down cleanly.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Time to pull the plug on the rest of the network and start to audit.&#8221;
      Boring, but essential work, checking every system file.</p>

    <p>The company internal firewall protecting the rest of the network was
      connected to the server by just the one cable quickly removed. It would need
      to be checked later.</p>

    <p>Now, hours later, things were nearly as puzzling as she had feared. The
      temporary, emasculated, server that Jon had lashed together had lasted only a
      few minutes before the incoming packets had become a full fledged denial of
      service attack.</p>

    <p>Although it had felt like admitting defeat, they had agreed to put the
      original server back on line. In seconds, the packet storm had abated.</p>

    <p>Apart from the unkillable process, now long extinct, nothing seemed amiss;
      even the obvious security checksums matched up. There was simply no sign of
      tampering across the operating system, and yet a steady pulse of obscure
      packets both in- and out-bound continued, seemingly emanating from the OS
      kernel, before reaching any of the overt mail or web servers.</p>

    <p>Celia felt tired, and ill at ease as she inserted the DVD and began the
      process of rebuilding a clone of the main server from its last backup, in the
      hopes that a comparison might show something. While the progress bar of the
      disk image transfer slowly ticked away, she fidgeted, tapping a complex
      rhythm on the desktop with her bracelet.</p>

    <p>Beside her, Martyn had given up trying to assist directly, and was
      scrawling away on his Palm, trying to frame a press release and a report to
      the company's owners against the event of needing to go off-line for a
      substantial period, while Jon was running equally fruitless checks on the
      firewall system. That, even more bizarrely, seemed truly untouched, with no
      strange processes logged or even any vaguely fishy packets originating there
      &#8212; it just passed all the anomalous ones.</p>

    <p>The banging of a door opening came as a surprise. A blond, bearded, head
      peered around the jamb, and asked, in a faintly sing-song accent</p>

    <p>&#8220;Is the 'net down at the moment? I can't get out to check the web right
      now.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;We had a penetration last night, Nils. I'm having to rebuild your
      server.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;How long do you expect it to take? Or should I use the dial-out for a
      while?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;An hour or so at least. Dilbert isn't that urgent, is it?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Haven't you heard the news? There's a transhuman construct in orbit, and
      it sounded on the radio that the government has been trying to cover things
      up. I wanted to keep up with what's happening, and check up on what the
      extropian groups are saying.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;In orbit? What? What sort of thing?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I don't know. That's what I wanted to find out. The news has been full of
      talk about how this will affect us all, and trying to analyse the statement
      that the transhuman has made &#8212; though they were calling her an alien. I was
      hoping to keep up with the real buzz on the 'net. Someone must have posted
      the video, and the extropian groups will be going wild.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Celia smiled wryly. Nils had always seemed one of the flakier old
      hippy-wannabes of her acquaintance, and that sort of thing would be right up
      his street. Turning to check the progress of the install, she tuned out his
      patter, until a phrase caught her attention. Grabbing it by the tail, she
      hauled it into consciousness, and inspected it.</p>

    <p>&#8220;What do you mean &#8212; compromised the root name servers?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Well, she's set herself up a dot-int domain, putting herself into that
      select club along with NATO, the EU, and Intelsat, and I don't know of any others.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I don't think you can get those domain names for &euro;12+VAT, discounts
      for bulk.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Tell me more&#8230;&#8221;</p>

    <h1>12:00</h1>

    <p>Behind the scenes at the conference, Carolyn was in an increasing state of
      panic.</p>

    <p>She had expected the anxiety and confusion at Heathrow, trying to get in
      contact with both the driver of the limousine that the airline had organized,
      and her distinguished guest. It had been as hectic as she had expected,
      flights flooding in as normal, with the usual air traffic control snarl-ups
      adding to the confusion, as people still waiting for delayed arrivals clogged
      the hall.</p>

    <p>It had taken a while to find the driver in the press of people, and then
      there had been the tedious wait for the emergence of passengers from the
      Moscow flight. While they waited for that contingent to emerge from the
      democratising embrace of Customs &amp; Excise, she had watched the flow of
      people pass, lost or confident, many carrying foreign newspapers with similar
      UFO pictures on their front pages.</p>

    <p>That intrusion of the bizarre into the, if not everyday, at least the
      conventional, had been inevitable, she had felt. What she had not expected
      were the events of the journey back.</p>

    <p>As befitted one who moved amongst the upper echelons of the world, the
      World Bank president had greeted her in a practised manner, though somewhat
      distractedly, after emerging from customs and confidently locating his
      driver. He had, then, in true alpha male style, swept them swiftly to the
      waiting car.</p>

    <p>Once aboard, with the chauffeur starting to negotiate the inevitable heavy
      traffic, he had apologised for his unfortunate discourtesy, and opened his
      briefcase to extract a slim-line laptop, with a small flip-up antenna that
      implied a built-in wireless modem of some sort, and plunged frantically into
      still more business.</p>

    <p>Hadn't he been able to connect from the plane? Were Aeroflot still so
      stuck in the twentieth century that they didn't yet offer GSM in First Class
      at least? Or was he, inevitably, a compulsive workaholic?</p>

    <p>Glimpses of the screen &#8212; a rather old-fashioned narrow viewing angle
      display, perhaps intentionally so for privacy, had not been reassuring. The
      Visitor &#8212; as it seemed they were calling the woman out of space, yet claiming
      to be from the future &#8212; was clearly at the centre of the distraction. Half
      glimpsed titles with phrases like &#8220;Damage assessment&#8221; or &#8220;Impact mitigation&#8221;
      were more that merely disquieting.. Was she seeing some overspill from some
      secret world governing cabal's reaction to this unforeseen event?</p>

    <p>&#8220;Not the most auspicious of days?&#8221; she plucked up the courage to enquire
      obliquely.</p>

    <p>&#8220;No, not really.&#8221; He looked up, slightly apologetically, and seemingly
      glad to return to the here and now for the moment. &#8220;We're having to react to
      events which we haven't even the vaguest contingency plans for, even if the
      US Army might. Worse, we don't know what is really happening &#8212; again unlike
      the American military.</p>

    <p>&#8220;You'll hear much of this on the News in time &#8212; but it appears that we
      have lost a number of our clients. We're not only being visited; there has
      been a wave of attacks from space upon, shall we say, some world leaders who
      were not good team players, to go along with the gifts.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I don't suppose you've had the chance yet to see those either&#8230;&#8221;</p>

    <p>He worked briefly at his keyboard, then turned the screen to show her a
      web page, plain and unadorned in style, with the title <cite>Portable
        zero-point catalysed fusion power pack</cite>.</p>

    <p>After a brief synopsis, and a link claiming to lead to a full exposition
      of the underlying physics in detail, were a set of engineering plans looking
      scarcely more complex than any of the appropriate technology devices she had
      herself encountered in various of the projects for lighting and irrigation
      that she had already been involved in.</p>

    <p>&#8220;And it works, or so I'm told.&#8221;</p>

    <p>And at this point her heart had begun to sink. This was the sort of thing
      that the conference was to be about, but far, far, beyond what was gong to be
      presented there. Rather than the simple and ingenious solar power, and
      perhaps devices built around fuel cells imported and powered ultimately by
      local biomass, requiring imported components, however cheap, for the crucial
      conversion of heat to electricity here was the Ideal &#8212; the Sun as
      hearth-fire&#8230;</p>

    <p>&#8220;May I?&#8221; she gestured at the keyboard.</p>

    <p>At his nod and grunt, she had taken the computer, and followed the
      'Information Home' link to explore the full cornucopia &#8212; or Pandora's box &#8212;
      that the Visitor was offering, in the way of medicines, warnings of natural
      disasters, and pure science. The majority of the material was beyond her, but
      the headlines and introductions were fascinating, or even horrifying, but
      completely compelling.</p>

    <p>Then something triggered a memory of what she'd heard on the news.</p>

    <p>&#8220;The Visitor &#8212; what did she mean about ballistic missiles?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Some military organizations were rather trigger-happy. Some of them have
      claimed that it was intended as a strike against a possible asteroid impact,
      but she doesn't see it that way.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Go to her home page &#8212; just <code>www.ascension.int</code> &#8212; and then follow
      the politics link. It has the video-clip she broadcast, and the list of
      places she struck against. Not only a number of missile launch sites &#8212;
      Elvis sightings aside, a lot
      of well-known names will only be appearing in the obituary pages; as well as
      many more obscure ones.&#8221;</p>

    <p>She continued to read, horridly fascinated, with occasional questions,
      until they had arrived at the LSE, where the conference was being held. The
      halting of the car had brought her suddenly to the here and now.</p>

    <p>The usual scattering of protesters were loitering outside, attracted by
      the presence of a World Bank official, and monitored by a few bored-looking
      police &#8212; co-opting many of the agitator groups into participation seemed to
      have helped on that front. What she hadn't expected were the number of truly
      weird types protesting the arrogance of the conference agenda in the face of
      the beneficence of the UFO gods, and appealing for their forbearance.</p>

    <p>And so, it had transpired, thought many of the delegates. Presentations
      that only hours before had seemed vital were now rendered trite, and the
      speakers &#8212; even those who had been in blissful ignorance of what the Visitor
      was actually giving away, spoke without their wonted enthusiasm.</p>

    <p>Proceedings were continuing, but it seemed to be doing so mechanically,
      distractedly. Painfully few of the delegates were actually fired up by the
      new technical information available, and their contributions were the only
      things that had kept her from abandoning the whole thing.</p>

    <h1>15:00</h1>

    <p>Butterflies gathered in Celia's stomach as she prepared to present her
      findings to a meeting of the whole company. There may only have been a score
      of them, but the idea of even small-scale public speaking made her palms
      sweat.</p>

    <p>It had been lunchtime when the break had come. By then, fatigue had been
      setting in, as her body started to insist that it was getting to be a
      sensible siesta time.</p>

    <p>Wearily, she had wandered out to the office kitchen for yet another
      <cite>Jolt</cite> to wash down the chicken tikka baguette and jumbo club bap
      which Jon had fetched for her from one of the local sandwich shops. As she
      sat there, munching, vacantly staring out of the windows towards the nearby
      railway lines, she was ready to finally admit to herself that, in this first
      real test of her skills, she had failed. At least she was not alone &#8212; as Nils
      had noted, it did seem that the root nameservers had been hacked.
    </p>

    <p>She had briefly visited the Visitor's site, and tried to see if CERT had
      any light to shed on that issue &#8212; or her own problem. There were others who
      seemed to have been encountering the same sort of problems, but no diagnoses
      had been posted so far, let alone solutions; only the reminder that in
      previous worm attacks, those who'd been affected, but stayed connected had
      benefited from fixes much sooner than those who had dropped off-net to wait
      for the all clear by other routes.</p>

    <p>Still, all the checksums had matched, all the system tests worked, and
      there seemed no obvious differences in behaviour between the compromised
      system, and the restored image. There just didn't seem to be any way of
      screening the stray extraneous communications.</p>

    <p>Eventually, in response to overwhelming demand, she had conceded and
      connected a couple of machines to the server to allow 'net access for the
      staff, but also monitoring the traffic as it went for evidence of intrusion,
      and had meanwhile continued to make her own increasingly desperate attempts
      to gain a handle on the problem.</p>

    <p>Her down-beat reverie had been interrupted by Nils bursting into the room,
      clearly ready with some revelation.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Hey, Celia, I just did something you might find interesting. Come have a
      look!&#8221;</p>

    <p>He led her to one of the external access machines, brought up a console
      window, and typed</p>
    <pre><code>tracert www.ascension.int</code></pre>

    <p>and pointed gleefully at the trace, which took only one hop, just as far
      as the compromised server. Checking the low-level network activity confirmed
      this &#8212; the ascension name came up matched to the address of the local
      server.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I was just interested to see where the Visitor had made her attack. I
      hadn't expected it to be us.&#8221; he explained.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I don't want to sound melodramatic, Celia, but I think we're under
      Transcendent attack.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Nils, explain what you mean.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;That's the whole problem. I can't, roughly by definition. If the Visitor
      has enough high technology, she can work magic, so long as it is logically
      possible.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Anything at all?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;So long as it's not self-contradictory.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;That gives me a very nasty idea. Unfortunately it may be difficult to
      prove. Security engineering has been likened to programming Satan's computer
      &#8212; and here we have, keeping the theological point of view, a computer which
      has been subverted by the Visitor, who is a self-confessed daughter of Eve,
      with transhuman powers at her command.</p>

    <p>&#8220;And transhuman is the term Dante used &#8212; or at least Dorothy Sayers used
      on his behalf in her translation of the <cite>Paradiso</cite> back in the
      Fifties &#8212; to describe even his own state while ascending into Heaven. Put
      them together, and you have Fallen plus angelic. I think you can do the sum
      here.</p>

    <p>&#8220;So, we will be even more at risk falling foul of the illusion of images &#8212;
      the fact that everything we see on a computer screen is being calculated by
      that processor. And as a starting point, we know that we don't trust what it
      is doing.</p>

    <p>&#8220;What I'm looking to try is to see if we can actually compare files on the
      old server and the restored back-up image, because a transhuman could
      logically possibly compute two different files that have identical hash
      values for a number of different hashes.</p>

    <p>&#8220;About all we can say is that the behaviour of the intrusion so far is one
      of indifference &#8212; everything seems to work just as expected apart from a
      small levy of processor power to run what looks like it might be acting as a
      distributed web server. So let's copy a few key system files across to one of
      the client machines, and see about running some simple diffs.&#8221;</p>

    <p>She spent a few minutes writing a minimal comparison program, just in case
      there might be a specific defence against the standard one, and then copied a
      few system files for testing. She held her breath as she kicked off the
      experiment.</p>

    <p>Immediately, the screen started to fill with the lines</p>
    <pre><code>files differ
MD5 equal
SHA equal</code></pre>

    <p>&#8220;The bitch!&#8221; she had cried. &#8220;She did hack the hashes. We may not have the
      all the answers, but this is worth posting. Just a few more experiments,
      because we know there are a few things she physically cannot do.&#8221;</p>

    <p>With some feeling of satisfaction she had started to compose a message for
      CERT, Counterpane, and a number of other security freelancers of her
      acquaintance.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><code>Subject: Hash collisions in ascension.int related intrusion
  incidents</code></p>

      <p><code>In responding to an intrusion detected at a client site commencing
  at approximately 02:00 UTC, I observed a transient process called optimad.
  This process seemed to be associated with an attack against the mail
  server, and resulted in significant network traffic emanating unprompted
  from the OS kernel rather than resulting from the activity of application
  code.</code></p>

      <p><code>Normal comparison of strong hashes of system files revealed no
  difference from values stored on pre-existing read-only media.</code></p>

      <p><code>Later, it was observed that the compromised server was acting as an
  instance of www.ascension.int, and was perhaps subverted to form part of a
  distributed server.</code></p>

      <p><code>Performing direct comparisons showed that some of the system files
  had been changed, but that the hash values for all major hashes and
  checksums were identical. Trying off-beat hashes such as running unusual
  cyphers as a hash did show difference, as do keyed hashes.</code></p>

      <p><code>I believe that the attack originated with the Visitor, and that she
  has at her disposal some "transcendent", as I believe is the jargon, level
  of computing power and is able to compute hash collisions at will.</code></p>

      <p><code>While it is possible for simple hashes to be fooled, and odd
  algorithms to be "immunized" against, there is not the space to fool
  arbitrarily keyed MACs.</code></p>

      <p><code>As a corollary, it would be prudent to assume that all encrypted
  communications are compromised, so the fact that this message is signed and
  encrypted is more a matter of habit.</code></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>She posted the message via a dial-out connection to her own ISP, with a
      feeling that it was much like launching a message in a bottle, with no
      certainty of it being received. And then it was off to give Martyn, and the
      MD, the news. And now they wanted her to brief the whole company, as well as
      the Japanese owners, staying up late, by speakerphone.</p>

    <h1>18:00</h1>

    <p>Cold wind and rain lashed the streets as Carolyn left the conference hall
      near Aldwych to return to her flat, tired after a day of frustrating meetings
      behind the scenes trying to keep the whole enterprise afloat. Worst, she
      secretly felt a smidgin of sympathy for the prevailing apathetic mindset.</p>

    <p>What point, she wondered, was there in trying to make any sense of a
      development policy for the Third World at a time like this, when the whole
      world had suddenly become an underdeveloped country, at least according to
      the Visitor, the enigmatic woman from the Future? It was hard to think that
      it was only hours since the announcement that she had heard that had cut
      across all broadcast channels, that the future was flawed, and that things
      would have to turn out differently this time.</p>

    <p>As she headed past Covent Garden, there seemed no changes in the great
      mass of people heading home, or out for the evening. Almost too much
      normality, despite the torrent of intrusions into the usual flow of events.
      While the web had acquired a horde of new sites dedicated to the proven
      events, accompanied by a heavy burden of UFO sightings, stale enigmas and
      some almost refreshing hysteria, the popular papers were already drifting &#8212;
      or running &#8212; back to the everyday, with soap and showbiz events beginning to
      reappear.</p>

    <p>And yet there were large structures growing in orbit, confused reports of
      halts or interruptions of long running low intensity fighting in Africa,
      Central Asia and elsewhere, in addition to the swift strikes she had read about
      that morning. America's Mid-west and the Middle East had manifested all sorts
      of religious outbreaks, triggered, it seemed by something that had happened
      in Jerusalem, driving everyone out.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Is this a waste of time?&#8221; she mused, as she crossed Holborn, heading
      east, into the quieter back streets. The aim of the conference surely had not
      ceased to be relevant, but were the means sufficient, if someone had come to
      alter the outcome of a world in which it had taken place without such an
      interruption.</p>

    <p>Emerging into Queen Square, she tugged her raincoat closer about her, as
      the wind gusted the rain at her. Here, she was alone, only a couple of other
      similarly hunched figures in sight, scurrying for shelter in the evening
      gloom. The heavy overcast was intensifying the closing in of the days as
      winter approached.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Ms. Wilson?&#8221; She startled, brought suddenly back to the here and now. The
      enquiry had been made by a small woman, bundled in a full chadoor, who had
      fallen into step beside her. The voice had been strangely accented, something
      that seemed to trigger recognition, but came from no region she could
      place.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Ms. Wilson,&#8221; the stranger started again, now seemingly sure that she had
      her attention, &#8220;I know you must be troubled by everything that has happened
      today, but you must not give up. Your work is very important to me, and where
      I come from. I'm not sure if you can really appreciate its worth.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Were you there today?&#8221; All her frustration exploded in the instant. &#8220;Half
      the people were looking to the Visitor to do all the work, and most of the
      rest were useless and would have been in the normal run of things.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I would have liked to have been there, but events precluded my presence.
      I'm planning to tomorrow. But it is all the more important that we talk now.
      But not here in the wind and weather.&#8221;</p>

    <p>The figure swaddled all in black, that glinted with raindrops in the
      streetlight, seemed unaffected by the elements, but Carolyn, the rain soaking
      her hair, and the wind chilling in the damp, was ready for shelter. But
      where?</p>

    <p>&#8220;There's a pub over the other side of the square. Would that do?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;It would not be,&#8221; the stranger paused, seeking the word, &#8220;appropriate.
      Somewhere more private.&#8221;</p>

    <p>If pubs were out, then coffee bars would probably be too. Without heading
      down into the West End for a <cite>Starbucks</cite>, or going onto a station
      concourse &#8212; which wouldn't be private &#8212; then even the reasonable, quiet
      places here didn't look that salubrious, and would not be the sort of place
      that someone of such a secluded culture as the full chadoor suggested, would
      feel comfortable entering.</p>

    <p>Take her home? Reluctantly, she supposed so. But why the reluctance? Too
      much city paranoia, Carolyn thought. She could defend herself well enough &#8212;
      had done a stint as a Guardian Angel years before, and still kept up her
      aikido &#8212; and would have little to fear from a small woman, unless she were
      packing like Keanu Reeves in <cite>the Matrix</cite> under all those
      wrappings.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I suppose you had better come to my flat, if you want to talk. It's only
      a few minutes walk, if you don't mind.&#8221;</p>

    <p>They walked together in silence, Carolyn's brief &#8212; and not very adroit,
      her mind still focused on business &#8212; attempts at small talk falling flat.</p>

    <p>The warm and dry in the lobby way was welcome, so the effort of climbing
      the stairs was not as onerous as it might have been, and then she was at her
      front door, unbarring the locks and bolts.</p>

    <p>She flung her coat on to a kitchen chair, and turned to her guest.</p>

    <p>The concealing garment she had thought black was revealed to be in fact of
      deepest blue, and looked to be entirely dry already. And then it seemed to
      flow.</p>

    <p>Carolyn's intent to offer her guest some tea or coffee died on her lips.
      She stepped back into the kitchen, falling reflexively into a defensive
      stance, and watched with horrified fascination. It was one thing to see this
      sort of thing in the movies, but in real life&#8230;</p>

    <p>And in moments the transformation was complete. The woman was now dressed
      in a long blue skirt, and tightly buttoned white shirt with short sleeves.
      Her skin was pale, smoky grey in colour, and her hair silver like metal
      wire.</p>

    <p>&#8220;It's good to get out of that rig!&#8221;, the Visitor remarked, &#8220;And, yes, I
      wouldn't say no to a coffee.&#8221;</p>

    <h1>21:00</h1>

    <p>Feeling the water getting cool, Celia turned on the hot tap, refreshing
      the washing-up water. Her lifestyle was dreadfully bohemian, with the washing
      up being done before meals.</p>

    <p>She stared out of the kitchen windows. Rain streamed down the panes,
      glittering in the light of one distant streetlamp visible through the garden
      hedge. The rest was black night. One of these years she might get around to
      putting up blinds to shut out the night.</p>

    <p>Above, the cloud was a solid sheet, with the reflected city light not
      bright enough to be visible by contrast with the indoor lighting.</p>

    <p>She checked the clock.</p>

    <p>If it were not overcast, she would have been able to see the Visitor's
      space station pass overhead again, as she had unwittingly done just that
      morning.</p>

    <p>It didn't seem such a little time ago. After presenting to the
      ArchiTechnix staff, she had driven home in the rain, feeling even less sure
      of her wakefulness than on the way in, and on getting home, had fallen
      straight into bed for a nap. This had delighted her cats, who disliked the
      cold and wet outdoors, and they had arranged themselves beside her, to take
      advantage of this hot-water bottle.</p>

    <p>Being somewhat seasonally affective, at this time of year, with the
      evenings closing in fast, she normally grudged every last minute of daylight,
      but with the rain already bringing on the evening, and the very early start
      for the day, she had had no qualms about sleep as soon as was safe. By mid
      evening, general discomfort and an outraged body clock had forced her back to
      wakefulness, and out of bed in the darkness.</p>

    <p>After tending to the immediate needs, including the demands of cats who,
      now she was up, were quick to remind her that it was well past their usual
      supper time, she contemplated feeding herself. With the hour and the weather
      she didn't feel enthused about heading in to Cambridge for a meal, or for
      walking over to the pub.</p>

    <p>It would have to be self catering, so she hauled out some of her emergency
      supplies for days like these &#8212; a can of chana daal, and a naan from the
      freezer, and then she had had to find a dish and cutlery. And so the washing
      up.</p>

    <p>In the background, the hi-fi played an old favourite, some of Satriani's
      energetic guitar &#8212; she had tried the radio, as was her normal habit, but the
      serious stations were still awash with talking heads trying the futile task
      of second-guessing Transhuman power, while government spokesmen stayed either
      silent or blandly reassuring.</p>

    <p>No mention had been made of the silent appropriation of the Internet, and
      who knew how many private networks. Little was even said of the strikes as
      upon Sodom and Gomorrah &#8212; but with far more finesse &#8212; that walked around the
      world as the Visitor had passed overhead. It did not seem to be fashionable
      to remark that on the whole, few of the victims would be missed.</p>

    <p>Even the reports of landings at Chernobyl, Jerusalem, and Texas that
      blazed across the 'net were hardly addressed. Only the vague hopes for some
      Utopian future seemed to have caught the popular imagination, a security
      blanket against the immediate uncertainties.</p>

    <p>For her own part, she could sympathise, but that came from the day spent
      in the trenches, losing the silent struggle against overwhelming power, and
      she had spent some time trying to get at the real facts. Vapid speculation
      didn't pass muster, so music took its place.</p>

    <p>The microwave pinged, and she took her meal through to the lounge, along
      with a half-litre of <cite>Spitfire</cite> to wash it down with. Sitting at
      the table, she dragged a couple of jars of pickle &#8212; lime &amp; chilli, and
      hot mango &#8212; from the collection of condiments, and a ten day old copy of
      <cite>the Economist</cite> from the pile of magazines.
    </p>

    <p>This was thin fare for her text addiction, the Americas and Finance
      sections which she had skipped when new. Now the tales of Latin American
      budgetary confusion and new initiatives in bank regulation seemed even more
      remote and irrelevant than usual.</p>

    <p>Her meal done, she abandoned the washing up in the cooling greasy water in
      the sink, and fetched another beer. Comfortably sorted, she settled into an
      armchair to sip her drink, and listen to music.</p>

    <p>Spotting the renewed opportunity, two of her cats ambled across, and
      reached some accommodation on her lap and chest. When they had settled into
      gently rumbling repose, she felt envious. With all the early start and
      earlier nap she didn't know what time of day it felt like; it just felt
      uncomfortable, neither a sleep-time nor a wake-time. At least the food and
      the beer transformed the general daze into a pleasant haze, if not yet a
      doze.</p>

    <p>The disk faded into silence. Even the rain that had been rattling against
      the windows in the occasional gusts had ceased. There was a distant glutinous
      sound of dripping, and closer to, the gentle rumblings of two cats not quite
      asleep. It was as near silence as could be achieved, and cosy.</p>

    <p>Then, suddenly, a change. Two sets of ears pricked up, though Celia
      herself could hear nothing. Then both cats uncurled and listened intently.
      She was about to ask them what the matter was, in the way that people who
      keep cats do, when she felt a tingling, almost a shiver, and the bracelet at
      her wrist felt suddenly like ice.</p>

    <p>At this point, the cats jumped off, and slunk away, Lump to a hidden
      corner under the table, and Jemmy to her favoured perch on one of the
      speakers on top of a bookcase, jammed into the few inches spare between it
      and the ceiling, where she could look out over the whole room and part of the
      garden while being inconspicuous herself. She wedged herself tightly into the
      nook, eyes blazing and ears hauled well back.</p>

    <p>Celia sat up from her slumped position, and looked around for whatever it
      might be that had spooked the cats. They didn't even get this worked up when
      defending their territory. Then at the edge of her hearing, the sound of
      silvery bells, and then the sound of hooves approaching from great distance.
      And then again, silence.</p>

    <p>What the blazes is going on now? she wondered, as the faint noises of a
      horse gently nickering and the jingling of tack could be heard. She stood
      cautiously and walked over to the table, where she retrieved a Handspring
      with a bulky battery pack and a wireless LAN module. Powering it up, she
      logged on to her home server. For what it was worth the link was encrypted,
      enough to keep Earthly eavesdroppers out, though she felt it unlikely that
      the Visitor might want to watch what she was doing amongst all the other
      swarms of traffic.</p>

    <p>With a window onto a full desktop, she brought up a view through the
      security camera over the front door as a knock sounded there. In the
      restricted 160x160 pixel view she could see the figure of a woman in light
      coloured clothing, and a single white horse standing in the road beyond.
      Something about the woman stirred strange memories which she couldn't place,
      but she was certain that this caller was no threat in and of herself, though
      the cats still showed their quiet terror.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Don't be such sillies!&#8221; she whispered to them, as she went to answer the
      repeated knock at the door.</p>

    <p>Opening it, she saw a young woman, younger than she had expected, still in
      her teens from the look of her, dressed in simple unbleached linen tunic and
      trews, decorated with knotwork embroidery in madder, her hair ash blonde,
      eyes blue, and a silver band at her wrist.</p>

    <p>&#8220;You!&#8221; Celia breathed in partial disbelief, &#8220;It really is you. But why?
      How?&#8221;</p>
