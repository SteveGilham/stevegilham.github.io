    <p>&#8220;So here goes.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Nancy Wolf sat in what seemed an infinite blankness, the control analogue
      of the self-enfolding StarGate <cite>Secret Rose</cite>. She had launched
      the program that the Seraph had provided, the one that would open the
      wormhole to the past, by stitching together an astronomical &#8212; more
      than astronomical &#8212; number of pre-existing paths in the quantum
      foam, back by a Planck time or so at each step, and forcing them wide
      enough for the <cite>Secret Rose</cite> to pass. She was aiming for Earth,
      at the opening of the third millennium, well before the untamed
      Singularity that had taken most of the human race, well before the space
      industries that had left one of the most significant remnant populations,
      so that there could be a more orderly, and complete Transcension. But with
      the inherent uncertainties in the process, she was now scattering herself,
      one world-line at a time, across the whole of the past, across all space,
      across a whole range of alternates.

    <p>Most of her world-lines would cluster near her own past, near the date
      that she intended. But a small fraction would be wildly out. But if there
      was anything in that past that she could bring to Transcension, she would.
      The drive that had been built into her whole structure by the Ascended,
      via the genome fixes supplied to her Clan, now reinforced by &#8212; a
      glimpsed experience? propaganda? direct rewriting? &#8212; her visit to
      Earth, and the floating mountains where the Ascended maintained contact
      with this perspective on the Dust, that drive would only let her turn back
      if there was nothing that could be redeemed in this past.</p>

    <p>A darkness appeared in the view, a star filled globe. The far end of the
      journey, rushing towards her.</p>

    <p>At a gesture, the timbre of the Engines altered. No longer careering down
      the tunnel, but holding station, as she launched a first set of probes,
      almost dumb specks, with the size and processing power of midges, held in
      a loose array by a network of forbidden channel resonances.</p>

    <p>The imperceptible cloud dived up and out of the well, dispersing in all
      directions to give a wide aperture array. The signal took an imperceptible
      time to integrate, then replaced the local view. Annotated, it showed that
      she was barely in the right neck of the woods &#8212; 5AU out, well south
      of the ecliptic, and over a decade later than intended. So far, not too
      bad. The motes continued to disperse, increasing their integrated
      resolution, and scanning over a broader range of frequencies.</p>

    <p>Almost at once, anomalies started to show. Even given the unfavourable
      viewpoint dominated by the southern hemisphere, up into Asia, Earth was
      unexpectedly quiet in radio wavelengths, and the optical showed too much
      red in the spectrum. She started to worry about being in a really
      low-likelihood alternate past &#8212; a Stapledonian occupation of
      Antarctica by Wellsian Martians with their red weed maybe. The local Mars
      was reassuringly quiet in radio, so there could only be a few
      radio-mediated dispersed cloud-jelly consciousnesses within the spectral
      bounds.</p>

    <p>The integrated image zoomed in on the Earth, a bright speck growing into
      a clouded ball, mainly dark under the cloud, but with a reddish blotch
      spreading out of the night-side where Antarctica ought to be. Sliding into
      the near infra-red, land and sea showed through the cloud. The coastlines
      revealed showed a massive rise in sea level compatible with the melting of
      the southern ice, and that the oceans were unusually warm, though not
      enough for super-hurricanes to sustain. Reverting to visual, and
      integrating, on the night side, some city lights showed. In orbit, nothing
      significant.
    </p>

    <p>This place was going to be a mess, a seriously different history, or
      both. But now she was committed.</p>

    <p>She let the Engines resume, and the <cite>Secret Rose</cite> settled the
      final distance to meet the worm-hole mouth and anchor it. That would
      radiate a significant amount of gravitational waves, and a lot of subtle
      particles &#8212; supersymmetric neutrino analogues, shadow matter
      particles, and gravitinos. It was unlikely that a technology of this era
      would be able to detect it. In any case, travelling at real-space speeds,
      the detection would be a distraction, an hour or so from now, after she
      had vacated this vicinity.</p>

    <p>The Engines roared again, and the gate, wormhole and all, dived under the
      surface of local spacetime, emerged again with the mass of the Moon
      between it and Earth. Now with sensors over the whole 50 kilometer
      aperture of the ring engaged, she was certain, as soon as her meatware
      consciousness could absorb the data, that the whole farside was as dead as
      it had been for aeons past, no farside installations, human or alien,
      showing anything out of local thermodynamic equilibrium.</p>

    <p>One final rumble, and the Engines stilled. Their last rattling action had
      scattered a number of sensor packages &#8212; bigger, brighter,
      wasp-sized, throughout cislunar space down into low Earth orbit, to sit,
      watch and wait, provide all the contextual information that she would
      need, and watch out for external interventions.</p>

    <p>Now the hard work would begin.</p>

    <p>Knowing that it would be a long time before she could again attend to the
      meat, she would call this a rest break &#8212; a last meal, purging of
      bladder and bowels, to acknowledge the flesh before she surrendered the
      chassis to mechanism.</p>

    <p>A floor appeared and so did local gravity. A reassuring illusion of
      windows between herself and the void beyond, the looming dark and
      dust-grey of the Moon which drowned the stars in this authentic display.
      And a door, leading into windowless corridors, and then into a room
      scattered with couches and real windows.</p>

    <p>She called for a beer, long, blonde and cold, and selection of light
      savouries, pulled up a chair and sat, feet on table, sipping and nibbling,
      watching the Moon slowly wheel past. In the background, gentle music,
      intricate and subtle. Deliberately, she turned her attention on her
      senses, and tried not to dwell too much on what now lay ahead, a broad
      telepathic scan of the entire planet, to find the pivotal individuals who
      she could recruit to her side &#8212; whether they bore any resemblance to
      the individuals she had expected to be working with.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Anomaly.&#8221; The automated systems &#8212; social insect
      level AIs &#8212; had found something that they felt required her personal
      intervention.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Display it here.&#8221;</p>

    <p>The ceiling turned from neutral into a display, corrected for her viewing
      angle, showing the limb of the Earth where dawn was rising over Arabia.
      And in low orbit, something that looked like insectile wings made out of
      white light.</p>

    <p>&#8220;What the dying&#8230;&#8221; she breathed the expletive, then in
      command voice &#8220;Relay this downstream. Get the Seraph, or failing
      that, the Linker archives, get an identification.&#8221;</p>

    <p>There was an delay of some tens of seconds, then a deep neutral voice
      spoke in her mind.</p>

    <p>&#8220;A Celestial. A pseudo-living artefact of some previous
      Transcension. Ascended investigations have reconstructed evidence that
      they were active on y/our Earth some tens of kiloyears ago, may have
      interacted with some of the last pre-humans, possibly causing a weak
      Transcension of some sort. Hypothesis &#8212; on this timeline, they
      stayed inert until recent historical times.&#8221;</p>

    <p>The voice of the archives fell silent, but this focus remained, she was
      sure, to record.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Oh, decrepitude! This is going to be a bitch.&#8221;</p>

    <p>The view briefly whited out, recovered as the central body at the focus
      of those wings of light activated itself in some fashion. In a reflex,
      Nancy felt shutters come down about her mind, while her body started to
      curl up, spilling food and drink. Conscious thought followed, slow as
      usual.</p>

    <p>Telepathic attack &#8212; but what she was sensing was merely the
      side-lobes, relayed through her sensor network, not at a level that could
      present any threat, especially with the regulators on the comms links. The
      main attack itself showed no finesse &#8212; there was a modulation that
      was spawning all sorts of less exotic radiation, mainly in the optical
      band or longer wavelength, enough to show the main lobe of the attack as a
      very narrow beam, maybe 25m across where it struck the Earth, somewhere in
      Japan, not too far from where, under a thick layer of cloud, Tokyo might
      have been. Aimed at an individual, or a small co-located group, she
      surmised.</p>

    <p>While it was pouring its energies Earthwards, and presumably was
      focussing what passed for attention there too, she cautiously steered her
      probe net to examine the construct. She didn't have Transcendent weaponry,
      the nearest being something geared towards defence and escape in the event
      of a bad take-off. Having to deal with something like that might be&#8230;
    </p>

    <p>Her thoughts were interrupted by a rush of positron-annihilation
      frequency gammas. Someone on Earth, not too far from the target of the
      telepathic attack, was fighting back with a particle beam weapon, but to
      no avail. The lacy, fractal structure of light continued its slow drift as
      the counter-attack splashed off the shielding surrounding the visible
      body.
    </p>

    <p>A part of her distributed net figuratively tapped her on the shoulder.
      There were human constructs &#8212; communications, surveillance and other
      types of satellite &#8212; in orbit, and a number were feeding views of
      this conflict along downlinks terminating near the earthbound end. This
      was going to be a place to be worth scanning later, when the dust had
      settled. And certainly a place to start her infiltration of the local
      internetwork infrastructure. She assigned a few dumb modules to that task
      and turned back to the main event.</p>

    <p>In the interim, it seemed that the guy downstairs had come to the
      conclusion that to continue with the beam weapon was futile &#8212; but
      not before Nancy had been able to gauge the effectiveness of the defence.
      A few sacrificial probes had measured the transmission rate of the
      positron beam, and by the time the results were presented to her they made
      reassuring reading. The beam had been within an order of magnitude of the
      flux density that would have been effective &#8212; and that would be
      within the capabilities of her own conventional weaponry to match, if the
      necessity arose.</p>

    <p>Minutes passed. The telepathic attack continued, though she cut off the
      relay from the probes so she didn't have to feel it in the background all
      the time. It would probably take some time for the necessary amounts of
      extra power to be brought on line to make an effective counter attack, she
      guessed. She could intervene &#8212; but without information, without
      context, she could not be sure what would be the right approach.</p>

    <p>And then it happened so fast she hardly caught it, only apprehended it on
      the replay. The Celestial unravelled in a burst of light, as something
      passed through it, elongated, deep red, somewhere between metal and
      ceramic in appearance. Vectors confirmed both that the launch point had
      been near the particle beam launch &#8212; and the centre of a sudden
      spreading clearing of the skies &#8212; and that having spent kinetic
      energy in passing through the shields and the target, that it would now
      swing around the Moon like an Apollo, then, interacting with the
      definitely non-spherical lunar potential well, impact the surface. That
      would be in just over three days time. Plenty in which to manoeuvre the
      StarGate to intercept.</p>

    <p>A few probes had hazarded active scans of the object under the cover of
      the impact, and as the results were passed through the network, she became
      less happy. That was not an object of human manufacture this side of the
      Singularity. In some senses it wasn't even properly material, composed of
      forces and particles not normally bound into cohesive form.</p>

    <p>This was getting to be a less happy prospect as the data flowed in. She
      had planned primarily for the main run of history, where the main concern
      would be the uplift of Asia and Africa's pre-civic societies, with despots
      and fanatics simply located, and eradicated or redirected. She had made
      provision in the form of some armaments for the unlikely scenario of
      global high-tech war, and for desperate straits, she carried on-board
      under rigorous Seraphic security, the means to force a hard take-off if
      faced with the likely obliteration by other means of whichever strand of
      humanity she encountered. And her strategy for dealing with any imminent
      Transcension was to have been simply to jump aboard and get carried along
      for the ride.
    </p>

    <p>This had the makings of both at once. With turn of the millennium
      technology, and samples of Transcendent manufacture, a hard take-off of
      some form would be too easy to spring. The original timetable was out the
      window. She would need to ramp up the production of the monitor agents,
      and that would still take days. If she had days. Otherwise it would have
      to be all aboard for the magical mystery tour.</p>

    <p>She itched to take a telepathic scan of the Japan end of the battle,
      but didn't want to risk anything that close to the center of activity that
      was not purely passive observation just at the moment. She could make a
      surreptitious in-person visit, but if she was forced into disclosure, she
      would be lost without unsubtle amounts of back-up. So she would just have
      to contain herself, while the preparations were made. At least the
      mechanical parts of the operation could continue &#8212; infiltration of
      the local networks, even the highest level scanning of the populace for
      key individuals. Meanwhile she felt the need to acquire an idiomatic
      command of Japanese, to add to the English and Arabic she had already
      crammed.</p>

    <p>Forty-eight hours common elapsed interval later, she was back on
      downstream Mars, overseeing monitor production, and still struggling with
      the disorganization of her conscious thought processes as her co-processor
      added a running simultaneous translation of her ruminations into yet
      another language that sliced reality in its own idiosyncratic fashion,
      when an explosion levelled the city that had defended itself from the
      orbiting Celestial.</p>

    <p>It was time to turn some attention to this other Earth.</p>

    <p>Sighing, she left the autofac to churn out more units, and took the
      wormhole route back to the <cite>Secret Rose</cite>.</p>

    <p>The time had been enough for more worrying data to accumulate. There was
      a neutrino-opaque spherical structure of comparable size to the StarGate
      directly under the now destroyed city. Worse, that and a number of other
      locations around the globe were effectively screened from telepathic
      probing. <em>That</em> was bad. That was unexpected technology.
    </p>

    <p>Many of the significant individuals from the same epoch on canonical
      Earth were absent &#8212; some dead in the cataclysm that had wiped
      Antarctica away, a decade and a half earlier, others simply not present in
      this slightly different history. Those that were present were usually
      working on other things &#8212; many on projects helping to restore what
      had been lost in the turmoil. Others were working for a UN agency that was
      apparently at the centre of these anomalous events. That was where she
      would have to take over the trail, sniffing around where it vanished into
      the shielded areas.
    </p>

    <p>It took many days, time she feared she did not have. But eventually, by
      their effects on others, she found two clandestine factions &#8212;
      cabals, really &#8212; within that agency striving to use this fortuitous
      find of Transcendent creation to engineer their own Transcensions. One
      &#8212; notionally the upper command levels &#8212; was for promoting a
      hard take-off of the &#8220;kill them all and let God sort them out&#8221;
      school, reckless beyond belief. The other, the executive arm, based in the
      Japanese location, was striving more selfishly for apotheosis, hoping to
      drag everyone into some more exalted state.</p>

    <p>And both had Celestial level armaments.</p>

    <p>And things were coming to a head imminently.</p>

    <p>There would be a confrontation between the two cabals, that she could
      tell. And of the two, Japan seemed the least worst. So that would be how
      she would intervene.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Maya Ibuki stared, not really conscious of what she was looking at, at
      the terminal on her desk. Everyone around her was struck by the same
      general feeling of anti-climax. The last, the subtlest, Angel, had been
      destroyed. Their job was over &#8212; wasn't it? Soon she would have to
      think about what came next. Her never too clearly formulated plans to
      follow Ritsuko as her assistant into whatever corporate or academic
      research she would move on to were dashed by the fact that Ritsuko was now
      under arrest for some ill-defined act of sabotage against NERV. Perhaps
      she would have to join the general reconstruction efforts, if they were
      re-deployed under the UN.
    </p>

    <p>It took her some seconds to realise that they were being called to first
      stage alert &#8212; and that the MAGI systems were under attack, not as
      before from an Angel, but from their peers in the other remaining NERV
      subordinate branches &#8212; but training and experience had her
      responding to the attack, and giving status updates, as quickly as was
      humanly possible. If only Ritsuko were here. She would be better able to
      cope, to reconfigure those avatars of Naoko Akagi to defend themselves.
    </p>

    <p>As she settled herself down to work, she reflected how the quasi-sentient
      nature of the MAGI systems had changed this sort of security
      countermeasure work. They could not just drop the entire system off-line
      &#8212; not simply because it would render headquarters blind to the wider
      world, but because it would inflict unacceptable trauma on the MAGI, just
      as an amputation would affect a human being. But the attacks were not the
      simple buffer overruns of a decade or more earlier, but conducted at a
      more human pace, in a more human style, to infiltrate a system in ways
      that were akin to subverting a human intellect.</p>

    <p>She was deep into flow when she heard a cheer go up around her. The
      Commander was escorting Ritsuko onto the command level. She did not know
      what had happened, but it was clear from their body language that neither
      wanted to be in the same room together.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Good work, Maya,&#8221; Ritsuko said, as she looked over her
      shoulder, while picking her own laptop from the next desk, &#8220;Now
      please open the access hatch for Caspar.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Yes, ma'am!&#8221; She let herself feel that things might just be
      going to turn out all right. With that reassurance, she turned back to
      coding, feeling that all was going well.</p>

    <p>The relentless pressure of the attack stepped up, but with Ritsuko there,
      it seemed that the march of red subversion markers across the status
      display was being slowed.</p>

    <p>And then it happened.</p>

    <p>One subsystem flipped from red to grey. Grey!? And then in a cascade, it
      wiped both other colours from the board. Her terminal locked up &#8212;
      and so it seemed had all the rest.</p>

    <p>In the sudden astonished silence, everyone could hear Ritsuko's anguished
      howl &#8220;Mother!&#8221;</p>

    <p>Then a new female voice on the speakers.</p>

    <p>&#8220;System Harmony on-line. MAGI virtualization complete.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;System Rhapsody on-line. MAGI virtualization complete.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;System Destiny on-line. MAGI virtualization complete.&#8221;</p>

    <p>The status display refreshed. Each of the three main MAGUS boxes had been
      relabelled. And inside each were three smaller boxes labelled as the
      original MAGI. In two of the systems, all the inner MAGI were green, but
      in Harmony, the outward facing node, the red showed as it had before the
      interruption. It seemed that the whole attack was being directed at the
      one node, and it was reacting as if they were still defending against the
      attack.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Status report.&#8221; The Commander was abrupt as usual.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I think someone is amusing themselves at our expense,&#8221;
      Shigeru volunteered, &#8220;Those names are from <span class="hint"

    <p>&#8220;All systems appear normal when running on the two inner nodes. The
      outer node is acting as a honey-pot,&#8221; Makoto added the pertinent
      facts.</p>

    <p>&#8220;So a new player has entered the game.&#8221; The Commander seemed
      almost pleased. &#8220;Well, let us see what their next move will
      be.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Massive energy release directly overhead! Altitude 10,000. It's
      fifty kilometers across.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Outside view.&#8221;</p>

    <p>The main screen cleared of the default tactical display, showed an
      external camera looking up. Clouds were coming into being, alive with
      lightning, and then suddenly cleared, to show a Moon in a dark sky, a moon
      too close, a sky too dark for a normal morning. And then the usual sky
      returned, with a band of bright metal floating in the sunlight. Darkness
      drifted down from it, like rain seen from a distant cloud, and lances of
      light struck the earth, raising explosions.</p>

    <p>A number of external cameras suddenly failed. In other views, there were
      glimpses of black clad, masked figures, and black capsules, with bright
      yellow blazes, floating in pursuit.</p>

    <p>The new voice of what had been the MAGI spoke again.</p>

    <p>&#8220;This facility is under attack from elements of the JSSDF including
      special forces units. We are being defended. Some special force units have
      penetrated the outer facilities, but will shortly be neutralized by allied
      monitor units.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Strong AT field detected!&#8221; Makoto again. He paused, waiting
      for more information to come in. &#8220;Analysing&#8230; pattern&#8230;
      pattern is Grey!?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Is it another Angel?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;It's at least as human as Kaworu was. But the pattern is
      definitely not Blue, repeat, <em>negative</em> on Blue.</p>

    <p>&#8220;It's inside the geofront. It's headed here. 100 meters&#8230; 50
      meters&#8230;It's here.&#8221;</p>

    <p>He leapt up, pointing at one of the emergency egress shafts. A small
      figure drifted down into sight. For a moment, Maya thought that it might
      be Rei &#8212; the same slight figure, the same blue-greyish hair. But
      pale though the First Child might be, she did not have the literally ashen
      pallor, skin the colour of wood ash, that this one had.</p>

    <div class="hide" style="float:right;">
      <div
        style="padding:5px;border: black 1px solid;text-align: center;background-color: #eee;color:inherit">
        <img height="512" width="512" src="00004-767301463.webp"
          alt="Nancy arrives at NERV" />
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>And what at first had seemed perhaps the white of Rei's plug-suit
      resolved into a white jacket over a blue leotard, and high white boots.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;That's&#8230;&#8221; Shigeru began.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I recognise the reference, Mr.Aoba,&#8221; the Commander spoke
      dryly, &#8220;<span class="hint"
        title="Lovely Angel Yuri (Dirty Pair Flash)">Another
        Angel</span>.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;We are now under siege.&#8221; The newcomer spoke, and despite
      its amplification, the voice sounded like Rei's, the same flat affect.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the Commander, &#8220;the old men have made
      their move. And from the fact that I am still alive, I deduce that you
      have chosen to stand with me on this matter, Miss&#8230;?&#8221;</p>

    <p>The figure drifted towards the Commander, followed by a group of
      blue-on-white capsules.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I am Nancy, Lady Wolf. But I think the name, the associations
      would better translate as <em>Kitsune</em>. Yes, call me Kitsune,
      Ikari-san.</p>

    <p>&#8220;And we stand together now only because their plan is much, much
      the worse. Launching a Transcension is always a hazardous matter. Theirs
      would be reckless beyond all contemplation.</p>

    <p>&#8220;For the moment I have bought us some time. I can hold off
      conventional armaments, even nuclear weapons, indefinitely, but your
      enemies have launched their Transcendent weapons. I can destroy their
      delivery systems, but when those weapons arrive I shall have to withdraw
      the StarGate.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I suggest that you ready your own Transcendent devices.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Yes. The Evangelions.&#8221;</p>

    <p>The Commander lifted his head from where he had been cradling it in his
      hands, a grim smile upon his face. &#8220;Pilot status?&#8221; he
      called.</p>

    <p>Maya called up the appropriate search. Rei &#8212; Rei's whereabouts were
      not showing. &#8220;Rei is&#8230;&#8221; missing, she was about to say.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;I am here.&#8221; The quiet voice sounded from the back of the
      deck. The First Child was standing there, wearing her usual school outfit,
      hands held limply by her sides.</p>

    <p>The newcomer, Kitsune, drifted down, alighted on the floor behind where
      Maya was sitting, and she turned to watch the confrontation.</p>

    <p>Kitsune and Rei just looked at each other.</p>

    <p>&#8220;You and I, we are very much alike.&#8221;</p>

    <p>She could not tell which of the two had spoken.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Nancy watched the strange girl who looked very much like she did. Even
      without probing, she could feel a strong telepathic shield about her. From
      his reactions, disguised though they might be, Gendo Ikari clearly felt
      that this was his agent, perhaps his closest ally, certainly his most
      loyal follower. And Ikari was a very, very subtle and intelligent man
      &#8212; an ally of convenience and no further. And no longer entirely
      human.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Continue,&#8221; she acknowledged that the staring match had
      interrupted Maya's report.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Asuka is still hospitalised &#8212; room 303. And Shinji is on
      level 3, just sitting in one of the corridors.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I do not know if I shall be able to pilot an Eva. Unit 01 rejected
      me, and I do not know if Unit 02 will accept me,&#8221; the quiet girl
      &#8212; Rei &#8212; stated, distantly.</p>

    <p>The exchange brought a lot more useful data into near verbal form, easy
      to read, a briefing that gave her the first substantial data to fill the
      gap she had been edging up towards for the recent weeks. It made
      depressing reading. The enigma here in front of her seemed fit, but could
      not pilot. The two other pilots, both children, were severely traumatized,
      according to their collected accounts &#8212; and a brief scan, jumping
      from mind to mind to find the children, confirmed it. There was something
      suspect about one of the two deployable units. And their were gaps in the
      deployment technology for the other. She verbalised her surprise and
      shock.</p>

    <p>&#8220;You have to power the thing, Unit 02, remotely? You have all these
      &#8212; these technologies,&#8221; she waved her hand vaguely to indicate
      the whole underground complex, which her accompanying monitors were slowly
      building up a comprehensive picture of, &#8220;and you don't have fusion?
      You're still using copper? You should at least have warm superconductors
      by now, surely. And you don't have a pilot who's fit?</p>

    <p>&#8220;Oh, well. Those problems are on a scale I can assist with.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Doctor Akagi &#8212; please take this monitor unit with you to
      Unit 02. I shall deliver a power plant and a fabber to retrofit it.
      Replacing the existing batteries or as a plug-in as you feel best.&#8221;
      She gestured, and one of the blue-striped white capsules drifted towards
      Ritsuko. &#8220;It will follow you. It has a natural language interface so
      you can tell it your design decision.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Major Katsuragi &#8212; please take me to Ms Soryu. Unit 02 needs
      a pilot. I will see what I can do to help her.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Meanwhile, I suspect it would be unwise to use Unit 01 under these
      circumstances &#8212; is that not so, Commander?&#8221;</p>

    <p>Gendo Ikari just stared at her, but did not deny the assertion.</p>

    <p>&#8220;And Commander, I suggest that you not attempt to precipitate
      anything unless we are about to be defeated anyway, despite our combined
      efforts. I came from an alternate future where a different type of Human
      Complement Program took place, under very different circumstances. I have
      learned its lessons, and I returned to the past to endeavour to ensure
      that things turn out right this time. Even if this isn't the past I was
      aiming for.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Nancy looked at Misato, nodded.</p>

    <p>&#8220;This way,&#8221; she indicated, and headed towards the lift
      platform where Rei still stood. Nancy followed.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I shall accompany you.&#8221; Rei stated the fact made obvious by
      not moving as Nancy and Misato joined her.</p>

    <p>As they rode the platform, Nancy shifted her outfit. By the time the lift
      halted, she was wearing urban camo trousers, comfortable dark grey boots
      and a silver-grey tank top.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Your&#8230;&#8221; Misato noticed the change.</p>

    <p>&#8220;This is more comfortable. The original display was fine for its
      amusement value, tweaking Gendo Ikari's nose, but if there is walking
      involved, I would rather do it without heels.&#8221;</p>

    <p>The three walked, and rode lifts, in near silence. Misato tried to
      banter, but soon gave up. Rei, it was apparent, was not a
      conversationalist, and Nancy herself was trying to supervise many
      different threads that she couldn't leave entirely to unattended
      mechanisms. While her monitors had neutralized the special forces
      incursions into the base, and now maintained a perimeter with distorts
      that would keep unshielded humans away, it would not be too much longer
      until the nine approaching aircraft with their ominous cargoes came within
      range of her main weapons, and would be shot down. Those would be the
      first shots of the final battle. And there was the other pilot to scan,
      check out, remotely, in case he might interfere, and dispatch monitors to
      guard.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Here.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Misato placed her hand on the doorknob, about to open the door, when
      Nancy asked &#8220;Why do you trust me, Major Katsuragi?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Because&#8230; Because you have asked, rather than taken by force
      when you could have. And because I think you are intending to stop his
      scheme as well&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;And are you acting of your own free will?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I'm here because you asked. Or are you asking something
      else?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;In every world-line I make a different choice. I don't know if
      that is free will or not.&#8221;</p>

    <p>They stepped into a bare, clinical room, where a teenage girl lay
      sprawled on a bed, surrounded by quietly beeping medical gear.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Catatonia, after physical and mental trauma&#8221; Misato
      explained.</p>

    <div class="hide" style="float:right;">
      <div
        style="padding:5px;border: black 1px solid;text-align: center;background-color: #eee;color:inherit">
        <img height="512" width="512" src="00008-410584643.webp"
          alt="Nancy at Asuka's bedside" />
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>Nancy approached the bed. She reached out her left hand, and stroked the
      girl's hair. At the same time, with the physical contact as a guide, she
      touched the girl's mind, and found it red raw with trauma. Some of the
      scars were old, from infancy. Others very recent. This untrained,
      unguarded mind had borne the brunt of the Angel's attack &#8212; it was
      surprising that she had not fallen into this state at once, that it had
      taken something else to finally tip her into the abyss.</p>

    <p>Her hand running through the red hair became the metaphor she used to
      work on the girl's damaged psyche. Some was like combing out tangles,
      gently teasing them out. But others she could do nothing about, save to
      cut them out &#8212; and that in itself would be more damage. Now, alas,
      was no time for regrets, for long drawn out delicate work. She did what
      was least worst to try and rebuild the girl's self-image, awaken the fires
      that had burned so low. If they were lucky, there would be time later for
      her to heal properly.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Wake up, Asuka,&#8221; she whispered, &#8220;We need
      you.&#8221;</p>

    <p>The girl's eyes flickered open, focussed.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Oh, it's you, wonder-girl. Go 'way.&#8221; and she rolled over.
      &#8220;Bitch!&#8221; she muttered under her breath.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Asuka!&#8221; Misato's delight at hearing any response was
      undisguised.</p>

    <p>At the sound of her voice, Asuka opened her eyes again, turned to look at
      Misato, and spotted Rei standing impassively by the door, looked up at
      Nancy, the two monitors hovering behind her, then back and forth a few
      times.</p>

    <p>&#8220;You're not wonder-girl. Who are you?&#8221;</p>

    <p>And then memory. She sat up abruptly, pulling free from various
      electrodes, her pajama jacket tugged open by the wires.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Where's that bastard Shinji. Did he&#8230;? Am I&#8230;?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>Nancy focussed the subtle senses of the monitors, checking the girl from
      head to toe.</p>

    <p>&#8220;No, you're just fine. I'm Kitsune, I'm here to help. Now, we have
      a challenge for you.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Asuka cocked her head, a half smile on her face.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Asuka,&#8221; Misato stepped forward, &#8220;Asuka, we need you
      to destroy the rest of the Eva series.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Why don't you ask Shinji the fucking hero. He can still pilot
      <em>his</em> Eva. Or wonder-girl there,&#8221; she pointed with her chin,
      &#8220;Kitsune, Misato can tell you &#8212; my synch ratio is
      zero.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Unit 00 is destroyed. And no-one else has synchronized to your
      Unit 02,&#8221; Rei stated.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Pilot Ikari is digging himself into the same sort of fugue state
      you were in. And for the moment, that's probably the safest place for him
      to be. For all our sakes,&#8221; and Nancy hoped that no-one else found
      out quite what was at stake, what Gendo Ikari's startlement had almost
      verbally blurted out to her, and what his son's mental state would mean in
      that eventuality, until later, after the crisis, &#8220;Now, go and
      surprise us.&#8221; And she gave a final psychic nudge along with the
      words.</p>

    <p>The girl broke into a wicked grin. &#8220;OK, foxy lady. Try me. Now, get
      me a plug-suit.&#8221;</p>
    <hr />

    <p>&#8220;What did she mean about Shinji?&#8221; Misato asked while they
      waited in the corridor for Asuka to dress.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Your other pilot attacked her. She wanted to know if he had gone
      further than common assault after she blacked out. And to answer your next
      question, yes, I can read minds.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Misato's face suddenly reddened.</p>

    <p>&#8220;After a while, everyone's own little secrets just blur into a
      mass. It gets old quick, playing the peeping tom. It <em>is</em> useful to
      pull extra bandwidth in conversation by picking up the unspoken contexts.
      But that is also why I asked those questions before.</p>

    <p>&#8220;So he told you that Asuka had gone wild and then collapsed when he
      tried to restrain her, when it was he who lost it. Death! Do you have to
      be damaged to do this job or does it just happen naturally?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;The children have to have been born after the Second Impact, and
      have lost their mothers. Isn't that enough? And we had to find children
      like that and send them out to be our front line soldiers. Or they have to
      be like Rei&#8230;&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Imperfect replicas of a dead woman. Like me.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;If I am a monster, then whose fault is it but my
      creator's?&#8221; Rei asked.</p>

    <p>The ward door opened, and Asuka stepped out.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Is the world ready for this?&#8221; she asked, spreading her arms
      wide, then, noticing the atmosphere, &#8220;Am I interrupting
      something?&#8221;</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Another elevator cage, cramped, descending through open darkness, with
      occasional red lights. They travelled in silence, with Asuka staying in
      the opposite corner to where Rei had planted herself, an obvious tension
      between the two &#8212; or at least on Asuka's part, something that hadn't
      been resolved by the butchery Nancy had perpetrated in lieu of careful
      psychic surgery.</p>

    <div class="hide" style="float:right;">
      <div
        style="padding:5px;border: black 1px solid;text-align: center;background-color: #eee;color:inherit">
        <img height="512" width="512" src="00007-1629588053.webp"
          alt="Asuka and Nancy head for the loading bay" />
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>&#8220;<span xml:lang="de">Mein Gott</span>!&#8221; Asuka broke the
      tension, &#8220;I can feel Unit 02. It's like I'm synchronized.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;That is because you are.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;But, Kitsune, how?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Because you have now awakened,&#8221; and she switched into
      English to misquote, &#8220;&#8216;Cometh the hour, cometh the
      woman&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

    <p>And at that moment, they descended into light, a vast hangar where a
      bright scarlet giant humanoid form was cradled in a network of catwalks.
      Amongst all the workers, Ritsuko Akagi's blonde hair and white lab-coat
      stood out, where she was supervising as a large armour plate was being
      fixed into place in the middle of the Eva's back.</p>

    <p>&#8220;It's different. You've&#8230; Where's the umbilical going to
      go?&#8221; Asuka spotted where the work was taking place.</p>

    <p>Nancy smiled at her. &#8220;We've made some changes. You'll see.&#8221;
      she said.</p>

    <p>The cage rattled to a halt, and the doors opened. Asuka was first out,
      running along the catwalk towards Ritsuko, waving. Misato just stared at
      her, an expression of deep hurt on her face. &#8220;She's not been like
      that for weeks. Can she keep it up?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;She's young. If there is time, she will heal.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Time? You think she'll die out there?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;It is not inconceivable. And there are other forces in
      motion.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Ikari?&#8221;</p>

    <p>Nancy nodded.</p>

    <p>&#8220;He can do nothing without me.&#8221; Rei added.</p>

    <p>Nancy turned to the girl, raised one eyebrow in question. But Rei was
      just staring blankly into the distance as she walked. And screened as she
      was, she was leaking nothing interesting on any band, not even to tell
      whether she was even aware of the gesture.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I am not his doll. The other one would have been.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Nancy could not be sure if that was intended as a continuation of the
      previous statement. There was something there, something that she was sure
      had to be important. But there was not the time to follow it up now. Nine
      targets were now acquired, were in range. She passed the command to fire
      back along the relay chain. High above, magnets realigned in the ring's
      massdriver chain, and nine clusters of kinetic kill weapons with
      significantly relativistic velocities tore through the atmosphere. She
      knew it would only cause delay, and not prevent the final onslaught, just
      as the earlier erasure of the SEELE cabal had not prevented the continued
      execution of their plans that had long been in motion.</p>

    <p>Two more commands, one to flip the <cite>Secret Rose</cite> half a world
      away, and the last to arm the ultimate resort, her own hard take-off
      capabilities, to fight fire with fire at the bitter end. Though she had
      not doubted it would, the acknowledgement that the last command had been
      received and acted upon were salutary. Even the Seraphim concurred with
      her analysis.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Kitsune! Kitsune?!&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I'm sorry, Major,&#8221; Nancy refocussed herself back into her
      own flesh, &#8220;I'm only post-human. There's a limit to the number of
      things I can work on in parallel.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I've done what I can about the other Evangelions. Now it's all up
      to our Pilot Soryu.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Misato nodded in acknowledgement. &#8220;Asuka, time to get you
      prepped,&#8221; she called the girl, and led her away.</p>

    <p>&#8220;And I owe you an apology too, Dr. Akagi. You are only here because
      I compelled you to be. And I'm afraid I have another task for you.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>The woman looked down at her, waiting.</p>

    <p>&#8220;You must stop Ikari reaching Unit 01. By any means
      necessary.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Ritsuko's eyes widened in shock.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Which&#8230;?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Either of them. The father could not hide the fact that that
      construct is capital-S Significant in his plans. And as for the son, well,
      I would rather have someone mentally competent at the helm of such a
      weapon.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I planned to kill Gendo anyway, for what he did to me, to my
      mother, but&#8230;&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Don't worry. The virtualized systems were taken as exact replicas
      of the MAGI state. Whatever of her resides in the MAGI engrams is now
      triplicated.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Ritsuko waved the remark away.</p>

    <p>&#8220;No, not that. I see what you did &#8212; it was impressive. I
      don't bear you any animosity for that, though I did have a shock. I had
      been in the process of hacking a backdoor into the self-destruct system so
      I could be sure I could stop him, take him and this whole rotten edifice
      down with me. But I think that you are here to do that job &#8212; aren't
      you?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;To save the world. Yes, that is why I am here. I only hope that I
      have the resources.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Dr. Akagi &#8212; I must ask you. Do you fear
      transcendence?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;The secret goal of the Human Instrumentality Project? As I fear
      any involuntary transformation of self. At best it would be like growing
      up. And adolescence was&#8230; a painful time. We have no guarantees here
      that what develops would be Friendly.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;So if it can be done with Love?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;That might be better &#8212; but the Commander, he is beyond
      madness. He makes Oedipus look underambitious. <span class="hint"
        title="Description stolen from Robert Anton Wilson's 'Illuminatus!'  and scriptually enhanced">He
        wants to replace God and possess the Universe. And he would crucify his
        only begotten son to do so.</span></p>

    <p>&#8220;But Shinji&#8230;&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Has only ever shown you his public face. Look.&#8221; And she
      grabbed the clotted memory she had taken from Asuka, threw it in Ritsuko's
      face, watched her hands rise to her throat to struggle with the
      recollection of strangulation. &#8220;Do you want that in the most
      dangerous of humankind's creations?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;So Asuka was&#8230; I guess the apple doesn't fall far from the
      tree. Very well. I will do what I have to.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;If you would rather, I can instruct the fabber to provide you with
      a non-lethal weapon.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Ritsuko lowered her gaze, no longer willing to meet Nancy's, shook her
      head.</p>

    <p>&#8220;If Gendo comes here, I have to be able to kill him. But I suspect
      that he will be heading beneath Terminal Dogma, to Adam.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Subtext radiated out along with the remark. Geography, the way she needed
      to go, the nomenclature &#8212; they named the lower depths of this place
      from Dante.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Stay here. Do not hesitate to shoot when you see your target. And
      I shall be waiting for him in Ca&iuml;na in your stead.&#8221; Traitors'
      hell. It seemed appropriate.</p>

    <p>&#8220;We're ready to start the launch of Unit 02,&#8221; Misato called,
      from across the hangar &#8220;Time to clear the decks.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;So. Unit 01, then,&#8221; Ritsuko patted the pocket that Nancy
      knew carried a pistol. &#8220;Thank you, Kitsune, whoever you are. You may
      have brought us hope.&#8221; And she walked away, head held high, certain,
      even hoping, that her own death was imminent.</p>

    <p>&#8220;We should be in the launch control room.&#8221; Rei stated, and
      walked off to where Misato had been, Nancy following her.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>From behind heavy armoured glass, they watched the entry plug being
      inserted into the spine of Unit 02, and then all the surrounding
      structures withdrawn, Nancy and Rei as spectators where Misato was leading
      the operations.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Where's Ritsuko?&#8221; she asked during a brief pause.</p>

    <p>&#8220;With Unit 01. In case the worst happens.&#8221;</p>

    <p>In the background, the checklist continued.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Approaching absolute borderline in
      1.0&#8230;0.7&#8230;0.5&#8230;0.3&#8230;0.1. Synchronization established.
      25&#8230; 60&#8230; 100&#8230; 140&#8230; peaking at 161%.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Pilot synchronization stable at 161%.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;That's a record,&#8221; Misato told them, then on the intercom,
      &#8220;Looking good, Asuka!&#8221;</p>

    <p>On the capsule monitor screen, the pilot raised one hand to give a V for
      victory salute, a gesture mimicked by the Evangelion.</p>

    <p>&#8220;She's not even touching the controls.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;That's what 150+% synch looks like.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;OK, Asuka, here's the latest sit rep.&#8221; Nancy leant
      forward, interrupting the technical chatter. &#8220;What I can tell you
      is that the nine units approaching us are white, have their own
      independent power sources, have flight capability, and they are carrying
      devices made from the same fake matter as the projectile that was launched
      from here against the 15<sup>th</sup> Angel.&#8221; The one that had been
      silently and immediately consumed by the Lagrange Clouds when it had
      reached the downstream end of the wormhole. The one that was clearly bad
      transhuman juju.</p>

    <p>&#8220;The good news is that you also have independent power and aerial
      capability. Plus you're patched in to my tactical net, and you have three
      billion monitors at your disposal, for all the good they'll do.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;And twelve thousand armour plates and my AT field.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Nancy nodded. Then, switching back to her first language, so that no-one
      else here would understand the desperate plea &#8220; <span
        xml:lang="x-ceqli" class="hint"
        title="Go save us, Red Woman, go save us all.">Ja taral gozi, Hoqxi, ja
        taral
        gozikul.</span>&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Unit 02 &#8212; launch!&#8221; Electrics crackled, and hummed as
      the linear drive took the red figure up and out of sight.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Three billion?&#8221; Misato asked.</p>

    <p>&#8220;They were intended to be mediating units assigned one to each
      person. They have a peacekeeping &#8212; peace making &#8212; function.
      They are monitors in the strict cybernetic sense. I've kept a few million
      back in case the JSSDF recover from their current attack of common sense
      and
      restart their offensive, and a few thousand for final defense of geofront
      personnel. I have other assets deployed for dealing with ballistic and
      cruise
      missile attacks. But the bulk of them are now Asuka's.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Unit 02 &#8212; deployed. Weapon systems &#8212;
      deployed.&#8221;</p>

    <p>External cameras now showed the red unit standing in broken woodland,
      surrounded by a major arsenal of appropriately scaled weapons.</p>

    <p>Nancy leaned over the console again.</p>

    <p>&#8220;You can feel the network?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Yes, Kitsune. This is awesome.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;You go, girl,&#8221; she called, &#8220;I have another battle to
      fight, but Major Katsuragi will be here.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Kitsune?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Thank you. I had forgotten what this was like.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;<span class="hint"
        title="Gratutious 'Plan 9 from Outer Space' allusion.">Watch the
        skies</span>, now. We can talk afterwards.&#8221;</p>

    <p>And she smiled while she said that, though she could not be sure that
      there would be an afterwards. But of those players who counted, she was
      sure that there was a tacit understanding that failure was not, could not
      be, an option. She had done all she could to counter SEELE's legacy. Now
      for NERV's.</p>

    <p>&#8220;It is time.&#8221; Rei spoke the words that Nancy was in the
      process of framing. Time for the confrontation with Ikari, she had meant.
      But what had Rei meant? The girl just looked impassively at her, then at
      the door, and began to walk.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>They were miles down now, descending in a small cage inside a set of
      intertwined spirals, in a cavern that was hundreds of meters across and
      deeper. There was no feeling of the Earth's tectonic heat despite the
      depth. A small part of Nancy wondered where this whole enigmatic shell had
      been in her history, which subtle chaotic drift of mantle convection
      current had taken it, and where. Had it breached the surface in one of the
      super-eruptions some tens of kiloyears before &#8212; Lake Taupo, perhaps?
      And how old was it? There was no easy way to date it &#8212; it could be
      as old as the Gardeners, that first hinted wave of Mind, whose traces were
      inferred from the sharing of deep idiosyncrasies of biochemistry across
      the galaxy.</p>

    <p>More of her watched the battle that raged above, a battle that was
      unfolding in a different way to how she had anticipated.</p>

    <p>When the Eva series had arrived, converging in a spiral, like soaring
      birds, then committing to land in a circle, maybe a kilometer across
      surrounding Unit 02, Asuka had taken up her artillery. Guided by the
      tactical net, the missiles impelled by her driving will, she had taken
      each one before it made the final stalling descent to zero altitude, zero
      velocity.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Nine birds down.&#8221; Makoto Hyuga, in the main control
      center.</p>

    <p>&#8220;What a bunch of wusses!&#8221; Asuku Langley Soryu, in Unit
      02.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Wait!&#8221; Misato Katsuragi, launch control.</p>

    <p>&#8220;They&#8230; The Eva series are reactivating!&#8221; Maya Ibuki,
      main control.</p>

    <p>Torn armour flowed together. Severed limbs, held in place, reattached. A
      flurry of fire had expended all Asuka's ammunition, slowing, but not
      halting the process. And one of the white units hauled itself to its feet,
      and flung its double ended blade at Unit 02.</p>

    <p>In response, a swarm of monitors arose from the trees, their autonomous
      programs responding with the default &#8220;Take the bullet.&#8221;
      reaction. The weapon flowed as it flew, forming into another of those red
      spiral forks. It penetrated the self-sacrificing monitors as if they were
      hardly there. But it interacted well enough with normal matter, that the
      sheer flux of transverse momentum deflected its flight.</p>

    <p>And Asuka plucked it from the air as it passed by her.</p>

    <p>And then the revelation.</p>

    <p>Nancy had discounted the monitors, their human scale weapons each as
      ineffective against an Eva as a midge against a battleship, even all
      assembled. But Asuka had seen them anew, seen the collective swarming
      action, a use that she, their forger, had not considered. Each unit could
      signal, could speak a warning, could communicate over a wide range of
      frequencies.
    </p>

    <p>In moments, the whole space of the conflict was a whirling storm of
      monitors, scarlet and black patterns sliding over their surfaces, a
      screaming maelstrom across the spectra &#8212; both audio and
      electromagnetic. She was using them as chaff, as flares, as fog. And for
      Asuka, that fog was Argus-eyed.</p>

    <p>Under its aegis, she pounced on the nearest enemy unit, a red blade in
      her hand, and began the work.</p>

    <p>Each of the white units was alone not a match for her, even in twos,
      sometimes threes, and soon she had both sword and shield, but so far only
      one of her opponents seemed to be down and staying down. Monitor losses
      were acceptable &#8212; only a few thousand so far, but the battle would
      be one of attrition, a race between Asuka's endurance and her ability to
      find something critical to destroy in the others.</p>

    <p>And then the relay cut, her awareness shrinking down to the inside of the
      elevator cage. But now she could feel the other mind here with her, could
      feel that the First Child had expanded her own screens to enclose them
      both, turning saw that the girl had undressed, her school uniform neatly
      folded on the floor, her skin flawless ivory, even to the nipples, and
      hairless.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;You have come,&#8221; Rei whispered, &#8220;<span class="hint"
        title="cf. Frodo's declaration at Orodruin (omitted from the film)">But
        do you choose now to do what you came to do?</span></p>

    <p>&#8220;Do you want to be one with me, of one mind and body and soul? It
      would be what you had always desired.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Nancy remembered Ritsuko Akagi's words, of the fear of the involuntary
      transformation of the self. And yet had she not set out on this project,
      this quest for <span class="hint"
        title="Greek for 'the good life' - and a topic worth Googling on">eudaimonia</span>,
      with the intent of immersing herself inside something finer, seeking the
      ego-null feeling of flow for now and forever, world without end? Had that
      not been the goal deep inside herself when, all those decades ago, her
      feet had been set on this path, or even before that, if she could trust
      her imperfect meatware memories? Yet, as she had asked Major Katsuragi,
      how could she tell if this was her true will or not? And even if it was
      so, how could she know what form the Telos would take?</p>

    <p>Now, inside her shields, she could see what place the First Child had
      within Gendo Ikari's schemes.</p>

    <p>&#8220;You are the Catalyst.&#8221; Nancy could not tell if that was
      spoken or whether she merely projected the thought.</p>

    <p>&#8220;And you also.&#8221; Now she could see that this was what Rei had
      meant by her assertion that they were alike, more than their superficial
      likeness of physical form, more than their shared manner of creation.</p>

    <p>She knew what must be done. This was the final leap of faith, the point
      of no return. This was where she found the meaning that justified her
      existence. Her outfit flowed, contracted, resolved into a silver block
      embedded in her right wrist, set with a deep blue gem. Then that too fell
      away.</p>

    <p>Rei held up her right hand. Nancy looked into her face, almost as in a
      mirror, save that the other's skin was coloured with haemoglobin and
      melanin, was not grey, and the eyes that met her gaze were red, not
      silver. Her mouth dry, her heart pounding, she held her left hand up to
      match. Their palms touched, merged. Nancy felt the tissues flow as they
      did when she let the wolf take over, but now they were mingled with
      another's though without any feeling of alien flesh being rejected. Now
      the other hand. And then the final step.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>In launch control, the pilot monitor station, Misato was feeling out of
      the loop on everything that counted.</p>

    <p>In the early stages of the battle, she had felt that she had to be there
      for Asuka, even if all the support she could give was moral. There had
      been the too easy shooting down of the Evas, and their reactivation, while
      Asuka grimly mowed them down again, leaning forward over the controls,
      smiling the familiar humourless smile from earlier, happier, days. Then
      something had happened, a movement she hadn't caught, and Asuka's synch
      ratio had spiked above 250%, held for a few seconds, before dropping back
      to just over 200%. At the same time all the external monitors had become
      blind. All she had was the Unit 02 telemetry, showing Asuka now lying
      back, eyes half closed, unfocussed, a slight frown on her face, her hands
      and fingers twitching slightly at the controls, as if she were asleep, and
      dreaming deeply. The fact that Asuka was immersed in LCL meant that Misato
      couldn't see whether the girl was drooling.</p>

    <p>Occasionally she spoke, in a disconnected voice, as if she was channeling
      something, or that the flesh was just an insignificant part of the whole.
      The only good news seemed to be in the content of these laconic messages
      that came at intervals of several minutes.</p>

    <p>&#8220;One target may be down.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Two possible kills. Three disarmed.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Three probable kills. Five disarmed.&#8221;</p>

    <p>The battle was not won yet, but there was nothing else that she &#8212;
      that anything human &#8212; could do. But there was something else she
      could be achieving &#8212; following the trail of Kaji's bequest, to find
      out what the hell was going on, what the real secrets were that her father
      had died to uncover, that had spawned Gehirn, and now NERV, what it was
      that Gendo Ikari had planned for the Angel imprisoned in the lowest levels
      of the geofront. And maybe even what this mysterious newcomer intended.
    </p>

    <p>She shivered. There was too much of Rei &#8212; of Kaworu, even &#8212;
      about this mysterious woman who called herself Fox, a name with all the
      undertones of shapeshifting tricksters. And those questions she had asked
      on the threshold of Asuka's room. Had they meant to be an oblique hint
      that she was being controlled? And if so, by whom? Kitsune herself, by
      force of will? Ikari, and all he stood for, by channelling her in certain
      directions? By the memory of her father, from guilt? She did not know her
      own true will. But there was a more physical, more tangible, puzzle for
      her to worry at.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I'm off, back,&#8221; the lie came easy, &#8220;Call me if
      there's any development.&#8221; She patted her phone to indicate. She
      waited until she was by herself in the corridor outside before patting her
      gun, to check the reassuring presence, drawing it, checking the magazine,
      and
      then reholstering. As if it would do any good.</p>

    <p>Nonetheless, it was time to get to the bottom of things.</p>

    <p>&#8220;It is time.&#8221; She remembered Rei's flat statement, before
      she too had left.</p>

    <p>How much time did she, did they all, have left? How close, how short the
      countdown remaining, until Third Impact?</p>

    <p>She felt that she was on the right track when on one of the lower levels,
      as she transferred between the various elevators, when she saw one &#8212;
      the last? &#8212; of the blue and white units that had followed Kitsune,
      hovering in the middle of the corridor. It did nothing &#8212; at least
      that she could see &#8212; as she sidled past it. It didn't even turn to
      follow her.</p>

    <p>Down, down into the pit. To the secured doors labelled as the LCL
      manufacturing plant, with its ominous shoot on sight warning. Doors that
      now stood open, as if their purpose was done, that there was nothing left
      to gain from concealment.</p>

    <p>Now, habit took over. She edged over to one wall, crept forward, three
      quarters flattened against the support, the cover.</p>

    <p>Voices ahead, speaking low, indistinct.</p>

    <p>Hardly breathing, she skulked forward the last yards to where the tunnel
      opened out into the chamber where the sad Angel was hanging, crucified,
      over the lake of plasm that they bottled and called Link Connection
      Liquid.</p>

    <p>Two figures. The Commander standing, arms crossed, save when he adjusted
      his glasses. And &#8212; and who? At first, she took it to be Rei standing
      there, naked. But then she realised that Ikari was looking up as he spoke
      to the woman, not down.</p>

    <p>As Misato stood there at the threshold, the woman turned her head. It was
      not a natural movement &#8212; only the head turned, further than seemed
      possible for normal human anatomy &#8212; but the face was Rei's, was
      Kitsune's. She spoke, in lower pitch, in a tone that carried further, but
      in the same flat style as Rei.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Do not be reticent, Major Katsuragi. The conclave is not yet
      quorate, and a human perspective would be,&#8221; a slight pause,
      &#8220;informative.&#8221;</p>

    <p>She let her gun, part drawn, slide back into its holster, pulled her
      jacket straight, stood up tall, and, taking a deep breath, strode
      forward. The Commander and the woman both watched her as she approached,
      without any perceptible change in expression.</p>

    <p>&#8220;What did you mean, a human perspective?&#8221;</p>

    <p>The woman turned, without seeming to move, just rotating about a vertical
      axis, to show a body simplified like a doll's &#8212; like an angel's
      &#8212; <span class="hint"
        title="cf. the Muse, Serendipity, in 'Dogma'">without definition</span>.
      Up close, there seemed to be a luminosity about the pale flesh. She looked
      down at Misato, spoke without moving those pale lips.</p>

    <p>&#8220;You are the only fully human entity who will be here. All the rest
      are something other.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Commander?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;It is true. I am fused with the embryo, the kernel, of the first
      Angel.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;But if you have Adam, then what&#8230;&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;&#8230;is that, Major?&#8221; The Commander's expression as he
      pointed up at the crucified figure could only barely be described as a
      smile, so bleak it was. &#8220;That is Lilith, the second Angel.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;<span class="hint"
        title="The fusion never refers to itself by a pronoun, neither 1st nor 3rd person">And
        this Ensemble</span>,&#8221; the pale woman, &#8220;that you previously
      knew as the First Child and as Kitsune, who was Nancy Elanor, Lady Wolf,
      also speaks for Lilith, who is a source of this flesh. The others will be
      present soon, now that the battle is over.&#8221;</p>

    <p>A light blossomed next to Ensemble, formed into the luminous form a
      woman, dark haired, clad in something long and white.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Yui,&#8221; the Commander spoke in recognition.</p>

    <p>&#8220;You know me as Unit 01, Major.&#8221; the woman spoke in a sweet
      voice.</p>

    <p>Could this be the soul of &#8212; ? She remembered the brute carnivore
      that had devoured the heart of the 14<sup>th</sup> Angel. And that had
      been this&#8230;?</p>

    <p>Something red next to the Commander resolved into the form of Asuka
      Langley Soryu, clad in her plug-suit, hanging limply in mid air, almost
      like a kitten being carried by the scruff of its neck, her body slightly
      curled, head slumped forward, face hidden in her long loose red hair,
      looking no more aware than she had been not so long ago, lying in that
      hospital bed. In the same remote voice that she had used from the capsule,
      she spoke.</p>

    <p>&#8220;<span class="hint"
        title="The last words from the Cross.  Very appropriate for Evangelion.">It
        is accomplished.</span>&#8221; A pause. &#8220;Dearest Misato. <span
        class="hint" title="From the first words of Phoenix to the X-Men">I am
        no longer the woman you knew.</span>&#8221; There was a hint of
      animation, of sorrow, about the voice in that second utterance.</p>

    <p>The four turned away from Misato, to the position opposite her, between
      the Commander and Ensemble. A siamese cat sat there, its fur a greyish
      shade of robin's egg blue, tending to indigo-black at the points, eyes
      shut, daintily washing one paw. It groomed itself for some moments, then
      put the paw down, wrapped its tail around its front feet, and opened eyes
      that were like sapphires.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I stand for the Seraphim.</p>

    <p>&#8220;All are now convened.&#8221; it announced, &#8220;The judgement
      can commence. State your positions.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I did all this to be with Yui.&#8221; &#8212; Gendo Ikari.</p>

    <p>&#8220;We cloned God, so that we could shout &#8216;<em>I
        am</em>&#8217; at the Universe, even after the Earth, and Moon, and Sun
      are gone. I am offered up on the altar to that end.&#8221; &#8212;
      Yui/Unit 01.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Wholeness is sought.&#8221; &#8212; Ensemble.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I am unforeseen. Help me.&#8221; &#8212; Asuka.</p>

    <p>There was a pause that opened up. Misato became aware of the intensity of
      the gazes upon her.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Me??&#8221; She swallowed hard. &#8220;I wanted to know what was
      going on. I want Kaji back. I want to be back home. I only know what I
      want.&#8221; There was a feeling of bitterness in her throat, like she was
      about to be sick. &#8220;No, if I'm honest, I don't even know that. I'm a
      mess. I can't speak for anyone. Even myself.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I offer only the forlorn hope, the last spin of the wheel, another
      spin of the cylinder, before the trigger is pulled.&#8221; &#8212; the
      cat.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Neko-san, may I&#8230;?&#8221; She did not know what was going
      on, what was implied. If she was to provide any sort of human perspective,
      she had to ask, to hope that she could understand at least superficially,
      before the end.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Ask your questions,&#8221; the cat acknowledged her request,
      &#8220;though not all those here will need you to voice them.&#8221; .</p>

    <p>&#8220;For my part, I represent the Powers on the Earth that spawned the
      woman you knew as Kitsune, from the future of a different past. I can
      unleash some of their capabilities, to indiscriminately distribute the
      keys to transcendence. It would be like opening Pandora's box &#8212; and
      perhaps, just perhaps, there might be hope at the very bottom. I am here
      for if all else fails.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Asuka,&#8221; this was the most pressing question, &#8220;what
      happened to you?&#8221;</p>

    <p>The limp form &#8212; the image &#8212; spoke again &#8220;I fought, I
      won, but now I am too large to fit back into the body that once housed me.
      To win, I over-synchronized, but not just with Unit 02, which is now but
      another small part of me. My original shell did not dissolve, but the 'I'
      that thinks is now spread across Kitsune's entire tactical net, all the
      monitors she assigned to me. This was not meant to happen. I cannot
      sustain &#8212; this nexus of flesh needs nourishment that cannot be
      supplied where it is, is not subsumed.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Indeed. Your use of the monitors was not something anticipated. As
      weapons they were discounted. Synchronization is the factor that was
      overlooked.&#8221; Ensemble. &#8220;Your immediate problem is but
      engineering. Modalities that you lack in your current configuration can be
      supplied. This does not cause an obvious conflict regarding outcome.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Or subsumption can be chosen, rather than exile.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Then the pale woman turned her white eyes, eyes that seemed to burn with
      inner lambency, towards Misato.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Some of the things that one wants to know, to find out, can only
      be appreciated by experiencing them. So it was with Kitsune. Such was the
      potential in the Ayanami series. Each of those different entities were
      also constructed with a higher goal in mind. This is the offer for each to
      step beyond the merely human &#8212; if you have trust in the guide.
      Unlike the unguided option that the Seraphim hold in reserve.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Kitsune &#8212; you warned <em>me</em> not to precipitate
      matters,&#8221; Gendo Ikari broke in, &#8220;Yet you did this.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;And if you had been warned not to breathe, or your heart not to
      beat? That was the strength of the imperative that faced those two. And
      things are not yet irreversible, as the very fact of this meeting makes
      abundantly clear.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Commander &#8212; what was the Instrumentality Program &#8212;
      what were you &#8212; trying to achieve?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;After the destruction of the other Angels, to use those that
      remained here under our control to attain the alchymic marriage of Adam
      and Lilith. For me, the reunion with Yui. For the rest of the world, what
      it willed. But Rei was to have been the key.&#8221; He looked sourly at
      Ensemble. &#8220;And she has taken her own path. Now, after Akagi did what
      she did, there is no replacement available.&#8221;</p>

    <p>One participant remained.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Who are you really? And what do you want?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I am the shade &#8212; perhaps the image &#8212; of she who was
      Yui Ikari. For a long time, I have slumbered, dreamed deep dreams. I
      dreamed I carried my son once again. Now, wakefulness has come upon me
      &#8212; I have been drawn out of reverie by this other image of that
      earlier self. My wants are simple &#8212; to sleep, to dream the Universe
      as the aeons pass, but I fear I shall simply be crucified throughout the
      ages, the last witness to the follies of Man.&#8221;</p>

    <p>There was a pause, a silence, save for the steady dripping of the plasm
      from the body of Lilith.</p>

    <p>&#8220;The resolution is obvious,&#8221; the cat stated, imperiously. It
      stood, arched its back, then extended each hind leg in turn, stretching
      out in a luxuriating fashion. And with no other word, turned its back,
      and, tail high, strode into strange distance, vanished. After a barely
      perceptible moment, the images of Yui Ikari and Asuka Soryu vanished.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221; Misato could not restrain the reaction. Something had
      happened that had gone past her. If she had provided a human perspective,
      what had she done? What had these others decided?</p>

    <p>Ensemble spoke again, reading, she was sure, this turmoil.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Do you still have trust, Major Katsuragi?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;You should be able to tell, shouldn't you? That I know that you're
      as fallible and as fucked up as the rest of us, that you can be sure. But
      then, that's nothing new. That's all we've ever had.&#8221; She looked up
      into that calm white face. &#8220;This is it, isn't it, you're going to do
      it. Third Impact. End of the world.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;No, not with a bang, but a sigh. Soon. <span class="hint"
        title="Allusion to the last chapter of 'The Last Battle' by CS Lewis">Soon
        the holidays will begin, for everyone.</span> After work is done. There
      is one task remaining before the curtain can come down. A final parting of
      ways that you must mediate, to bid farewell.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Ikari,&#8221; and the penetrating gaze turned away, &#8220;your
      fate is necessary and not to be envied. But you are acquiescent.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;In its way, it is what I sought, and many would say that it is
      more than I deserve.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Five billion years is but the blinking of an eye. Kitsune
      witnessed some of the nearer abyss, billion-fold later, after the stars
      have gone out, and the galaxies sundered. If there are other witnesses,
      they will gather by the deeps. Ascension is held now in abeyance for your
      journey.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Like the cat, Ensemble turned her back, and walked away, towards Lilith,
      walking on the surface of that yellow lake.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Major Katsuragi,&#8221; the Commander spoke, &#8220;As the only
      uncommitted agent here, I ask you, please escort me to Unit 01. It will be
      necessary to convince Dr. Akagi that I should be allowed to pilot our
      remaining Evangelion.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Me?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;You are the only one left to do it. And perhaps what friendship
      the two of you once had can persuade her to permit this, despite Kitsune's
      instructions to the contrary.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Can't she &#8212; what's left of her &#8212; do that?&#8221;
      looking out at the figure standing at the foot of the cross, dwarfed by
      the monstrous form of the Angel.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Can &#8212; certainly. Will &#8212; certainly not. She has
      delegated that task And at this point I know I no longer have meaningful
      authority over you, so cannot order it done. But I can say that if Adam or
      Eva remain here, then their presence will be disruptive. It may not be the
      Third Impact as you imagine, as a replay of the Second, but the negative
      effects on those that remain will be no less.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I do not know how long we have. But I suggest that we make
      haste.&#8221;</p>
    <hr />

    <p>&#8220;&#8230;and stay down.&#8221;</p>

    <p>The trance-like voice was the only useful data that Maya &#8212; that
      anyone in the main control room &#8212; had coming in from the outside
      world. They had long ago switched off the static-laced camera feeds.</p>

    <p>There was a long pause.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Pilot Soryu wishes to report that they were wusses after all.
      Misato? Kitsune?&#8221;</p>

    <p>Another pause. Just enough for sighs of relief and spontaneous applause
      to break out, not long enough to recover, realise that it was safe to
      speak, and to do so.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Kitsune? Oh, like&#8230;&#8221;</p>

    <p>And the voice faded, though the rest of the Unit 02 telemetry carried on
      in its monotonous fashion.</p>

    <p>&#8220;External sensors coming back on line.&#8221; Shigeru. &#8220;We
      only have one AT field in view, and it has Unit 02's signature.&#8221;</p>

    <p>The main screen lit up, showing the default tactical display with the
      terrain above the geofront, dominated by the crater that had been Tokyo-3,
      with the Eva's location marked. And, as live data were painted on, a
      massive spike, bigger than any of the Angels, in the same place.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Integrating surviving external cameras and <span class="hint"
        title="Optical synthetic aperture satellite system from Quicksilver by Reeves-Stevens">MAJIC</span>
      feed. Imaging coming up&#8230;&#8221;</p>

    <p>Everyone reacted with surprise as the screen was repainted with the
      synthesised image. The scene around where Unit 02 had emerged, in what had
      been wooded land beyond the outskirts of the city, was one of devastation,
      almost every tree smashed, the lake surface covered in floating debris.
      Already crows were settling on the scattered shards of synthetic flesh and
      armour that had been the Eva series. And in the midst of it all stood
      Asuka, a mile high, standing at rest, hands clasped in front of her at her
      waist, head held up to look at the sky, clad in the scarlet and black of
      her plug-suit, her flame coloured hair pouring down her back. <span
        class="hint"
        title="Where else to park the nine blades/Longinus Lances?">On her brow,
        a
        twisted wreath of crimson thorns</span>.</p>

    <div class="hide" style="float:right;">
      <div
        style="padding:5px;border: black 1px solid;text-align: center;background-color: #eee;color:inherit">

          alt="Asuka and the crown of thorns" />
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>&#8220;Asuka!&#8221; As stand in for Ritsuko, it was Maya's role to
      monitor the Eva pilots &#8212; pilot. Now the battle appeared over, they
      surely had to try and recover the Eva and its pilot &#8212; but what was
      that manifestation, what did it mean? All the life support system signals
      seemed to suggest that Asuka was &#8212; had been &#8212; in a comatose
      state. Only that almost unheard of 220% synch ratio that was still holding
      spoke otherwise. &#8220;Asuka!&#8221; she called again.</p>

    <p>After a pause which suggested that there would be no response, the slow
      voice again. &#8220;We are in conference. Please wait.&#8221;</p>

    <p>While Maya fretted with the limited controls she had available, trying to
      find out what had happened, whether this was going to require another
      salvage operation or quite what, the Sub-Commander was calling for other
      situation reports, and finally giving the command they had all been hoping
      for.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Stand down to regular watch.&#8221; and then continued,
      &#8220;and, Lt. Ibuki, now perhaps you could tell me what has happened to
      our pilot.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Insufficient data, sir. I don't know what was done to even wake
      her up, let alone enable her to synchronize like this. Her life signs are
      stable, and she appears to be in no immediate danger. Unit 02's life
      support capacity is currently open-ended, so there is no urgency in
      recovering her. And for the moment, she seems to be concentrating on
      something else other than us, so would most likely not cooperate.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>From the corner of her eye, she spotted a light winking on her board.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Sir? May I? It's Dr. Akagi.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Very well, go ahead.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Maya picked up the phone.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Maya, &#8221; Ritsuko's voice sounded agitated, &#8220;what's
      going on up there?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Uh, I think we've won. The Eva series have been destroyed. And
      Asuka's &#8212; well, probably OK, but you'd have to see for
      yourself.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I think you had better come down here, then. Something is
      happening to Unit 01 &#8212; it appears to be waking up. I need you to
      help put it back into cryostasis.&#8221;</p>

    <p>She relayed the message to Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki, who nodded
      dismissively, and picked up the red phone. Taking that as assent, Maya
      replied &#8220;I'm on my way.&#8221;</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Even jogging, even taking the moving ways, there was a respectable amount
      of ground to cover between the main mission control and the cage where
      Unit 01 was parked, the scale of the geofront being what it was. So it was
      with a little impatience that Maya answered her phone on the move when she
      saw it was Ritsuko calling.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Still <em xml:lang="fr">en route</em>,&#8221; she reported,
      trying not to fumble the handset.</p>

    <p>&#8220;We may be in big trouble,&#8221; Ritsuko announced,
      &#8220;Something has crawled out of one of Kitsune's devices and is
      starting to make changes to Unit 01.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;OK. There soon,&#8221; she gasped, and started running. But along
      with the automatic impulse to assist Ritsuko she found herself wondering
      what she was about to let herself in for. She didn't think that this would
      be as simple as guessing red wire or blue. But then there was a feeling
      that this wasn't going to be something she could run away from.</p>

    <p>She pounded down the last length of corridor, fumbled her card twice
      trying to swipe it through the reader, then with a deliberate effort to
      breathe slowly and deeply, despite the impulse to pant for air, she strode
      carefully in to the operations room overlooking Unit 01. She could see
      Ritsuko on the catwalk running in front of the Eva at its shoulder height,
      pacing nervously, looking up into its huge glowing eyes, and down at the
      metal spider that seemed to be weaving silver wire egg casings around the
      torso of the Eva. As she watched, one of the blue and white cylinders that
      Kitsune had brought drifted into reach of the spider, which caught it, and
      started to spin it into the growing mass.</p>

    <p>She took up the PA, and called down to Ritsuko, telling her that she was
      about to start cryostasis, then sat herself down at one of the
      technicians' workstations and fired it up. She was in the process of
      getting the configuration set up as she preferred it, when the door opened
      behind her.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Excellent.&#8221;</p>

    <p>She recognised the Commander's voice before she could even begin to turn
      around.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Sir,&#8221; the reflex salutation came out neutrally, as she spun
      her seat around, stood up, seeing that Misato was there too.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Commence launch readiness procedures for Unit 01,
      Lieutenant.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;But, Sir&#8230;&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Maya, &#8221; Misato spoke, &#8220;We have to launch Unit 01.
      It's that or &#8212; something as bad as Third Impact, as far as I can
      tell.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Is Shinji there? Where?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I shall be piloting Unit 01.&#8221; Ikari looked down at her,
      adjusted his glasses, then peered out into the hangar beyond, &#8220;Where
      is Dr. Akagi?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;She was out there on the transverse walkway.&#8221; But there was
      no sign but an abandoned clipboard.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Major Katsuragi, if you would take the door?&#8221;</p>

    <p>Maya was shocked to see Misato draw her gun, take a comfortable
      two-handed grasp of it, and aim at the door, keeping her body between the
      door and the Commander. Surprised, as there had been enough odd little
      incidents &#8212; unexpected accesses to sensitive data from TacOps
      workstations &#8212; recently to suggest that Misato had turned against
      whatever hidden agenda the Commander was following.</p>

    <p>The door opened, and Ritsuko started in, pistol first. Her eyes caught
      Maya's briefly, then she stopped, startled, on seeing Misato there too.
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Put it away, Ritsuko.&#8221; Misato sounded weary but firm.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I,&#8221; Ritsuko started, hesitated, &#8220;Why are
      <em>you</em> defending him?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;I understand you want to kill me, Dr. Akagi, and I understand why
      you do. If you let Major Katsuragi explain, then perhaps you will
      understand why you would be doing me a favour by doing so. But no-one
      else.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>Ritsuko was looking startled. Maya was sure that she wasn't doing much
      better at retaining her composure.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Commander Ikari is going to be aboard Unit 01 when we launch, and
      it is going to be sent out into space. It's going to be a one-way
      trip.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Project-E! You're going back to the first secret goal of Project-E
      &#8212; only&#8230;&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Yes. Only that did not include a pilot as part of the Witness
      program. But now it is imperative that I &#8212; or rather that Adam
      within me &#8212; is removed from the earthly sphere, and Eva &#8212; as
      now enhanced &#8212; is the only means we have to achieve that.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Ritsuko stood a moment in thought.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Damn you, Gendo. You win again. May it bring you everything you
      deserve.&#8221; She reversed her gun, held it out to Misato. &#8220;Take
      this. I need to get things ready. Plug-suit?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;That will not be needed. I have Kitsune's last gift.&#8221; He
      held out a block of silvery metal set with a blue gem, then turned his
      back and casually, efficiently, began to undress. Maya could not help
      noticing terrible scars on his back, running around his torso, before a
      wave of whiteness covered him. The Commander turned to face them again,
      dressed in a white plug-suit, with dark blue flashings &#8212; it looked
      almost like Rei's suit &#8212; not, as she had vaguely expected in the
      circumstances, the blue of Unit 01's pilot's, of Shinji Ikari's, suit. But
      what she first took to be the 00 designation was not &#8212; rather it was
      an infinity
      symbol &#8212; &#8734;</p>

    <p>&#8220;So that&#8230;?&#8221; Misato half asked a question.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Yes, Major, it is the thing I picked up from the elevator. Now, if
      you will excuse me, I need to embark.&#8221;</p>

    <p>And without further ceremony, he departed.</p>

    <p>Through the window, Maya watched him emerge from the pilot pre-flight
      area, and seat himself in the control unit, ready to be lifted into the
      entry plug. She couldn't tell from the distance whether his expression was
      that of a man going to face a firing squad, or one who had been reprieved
      from one, though she followed him until the hatch slid shut. And then it
      was all routine, despite the great silver fairings strapped around Eva
      Unit 01, like the wing cases of titanic beetles.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Misato watched the launch preparations as she always had, expecting the
      technical people to do their work at least as efficiently as she carried
      out hers. As the preparations advanced, as the entry plug carrying
      Commander Ikari was fitted into place, she wondered whether she ought not
      be contacting someone to inform them what was going on. But who? Not that
      there was anything anyone could do about the launch &#8212; and the main
      control room team would find out about it soon enough. Not that there was
      anything anyone could do about pretty much anything, even if she told them
      all.</p>

    <p>Twice, she picked up the phone to contact whoever might be in charge,
      hesitated, and put it down again.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Launch when ready!&#8221; she ordered.</p>

    <p>The various supports and restraints fell away, and the Evangelion began
      to move along the launch system rails, accelerating rapidly, quickly gone
      from sight as it began its final ascent.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Final restraints disengaged,&#8221; Maya reported a few seconds
      later, &#8220;<em xml:lang="fr">Bon voyage</em>, Commander.&#8221;</p>

    <p>She paused, reading the telemetry.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Pilot synch ratio approaching 100%. Environmental telemetry shows
      that the unit is under an acceleration of just under 2g, going straight
      up. I'm not sure how long we'll have signal &#8212; the system's not
      designed for long range operation like this.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I don't think it matters,&#8221; Misato said, &#8220;It's done,
      it's out of our hands now.&#8221;</p>

    <p>She felt ridiculously old, and tired, yet at the same time strangely
      elated, liberated, all her previous cares now meaningless, trivial.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I don't know how much longer we have. If there's anything you have
      to say to anybody, before it's too late, anyone you have to call, now's
      the time.</p>

    <p>&#8220;It's been a privilege to have worked with both of you. Ritsuko
      &#8212; I'm sorry things went sour between us recently. I remember the
      good times, I hope you do too. Maya, thank you for all your efforts
      against the Angels.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Now, I have one last thing to do. Goodbye.&#8221;</p>

    <p>And she turned and left, still wondering what had caused <span
        class="hint"
        title="'End of' seems to hint that Maya carries a torch for Ritsuko.  Here, she does.">the
        sudden shocked &#8212; almost guilty &#8212; expression on Maya's
        face</span> when she had as much as told them to say their final
      farewells. For her part &#8212; well, apart from Ritsuko, who was there
      that she was close enough to to want to spend what little time there was
      left with? So many of her relationships were just purely professional,
      mutual respect, rather than friendship or anything more intimate. And
      there was a limit to how much she could do by herself to set the world to
      rights, to tidy up loose ends. Who were there that she needed to speak to
      before the end? Kaji was dead, Asuka was changed, Pen-Pen was far away,
      and couldn't understand &#8212; but there was one person remaining that
      she needed to try and settle matters with, even if it meant wasting her
      last breath.</p>

    <p>Shinji.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>She found him near where she recalled the last trace had been.</p>

    <p>At any moment as she made the ascent, she had expected something, she
      knew not what, to call everything to a close. Around her, life seemed to
      go on almost as normal, strangely calm. At a couple of points, she had had
      to step aside as squads of NERV security went by, escorting prisoners who
      had been stripped to their underwear. Special Forces, she guessed. While
      exchanging reflex salutes, old habits had snapped in, &#8220;Don't forget
      &#8212; cavity searches before you leave the prisoners unattended,
      Sergeant!&#8221;</p>

    <p>But now, the last corridor, a couple of Kitsune's monitors floating
      seemingly aimlessly, and then, under a set of mesh stairs, in a half
      kneeling, half sprawled pose, the Third Child. Even for a gangly teenager,
      not sure how long his limbs were today, the pose had a singular lack of
      grace, more like a puppet, strings cut, tossed away into a corner to
      gather dust. He was clutching his Walkman to himself like a Bible. His
      eyes were open, in a thousand yard stare.</p>

    <p>She squatted down beside him, took the little foam plug out of one of his
      ears. She expected to hear the faint tinny sounds of the tape he always
      played &#8212; but there was only silence.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Shinji, pet,&#8221; she began. Without turning his head, without
      showing any other reaction, he took the wire from her hand, put the
      earpiece back again.</p>

    <p>The second time, she was ready for that reaction, caught the wrist,
      expecting a struggle, but on encountering resistance, he just gave up.
      Misato let the arm drop limply. This was his normal &#8212; well, it
      wasn't even active enough to be called dumb insolence &#8212; the way he
      just said &#8220;yes&#8221; to everything. She wondered if she might not
      have better spent the last remaining time once again trying to convince
      young Suzuhara to see &#8212; be seen by &#8212; his little sister, before
      the end. At least there she would expect to have met resistance, argument.
      Here, it was like speaking to a post.</p>

    <p>But now she had his ear &#8212; what could she say to him? That he would
      never pilot an Eva again &#8212; never have to. That his father had run
      away with his mother, had taken his Eva away from him for good. That Asuka
      had piloted her Eva, fought and won the last vital battle. Any of that,
      any talk of the present, would beat him down further, maybe destroy him.
      Should she just hold him? Most boys of his age would find being cuddled,
      the close physical contact, by an older woman secretly exciting &#8212;
      but on other occasions, Shinji had recoiled from her touch. She'd seen the
      surveillance tapes, the security debriefs, of him and Kaworu &#8212; was
      half the problem &#8212; beyond that of being fourteen &#8212; that he'd
      realised &#8212; feared, even &#8212; that he was gay?</p>

    <p>&#8220;Oh, Shinji, my boy &#8212; what are we going to do with
      you?&#8221;</p>

    <p>When she had been his age &#8212; that had been when the Second Impact,
      whatever the truth behind that, had happened. And she had spent years not
      talking, in not much better state that this, until the shock and horrors
      that she had experienced had played themselves in her head so many times
      that it eventually became boring, the damage callused over by thick layers
      of mere familiarity, and she could pick up the fragments of her life, and
      start again. Should she tell him that time would heal all these wounds,
      that eventually you got to a state where you could at least give the
      outward show that marked an adult, however you felt inside &#8212; that
      his father had managed that sort of public fa&ccedil;ade, that he could at
      least achieve that much. But there wouldn't <em>be</em> time.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Oh, Kitsune, how long?&#8221;</p>

    <p>But if not for her intervention, then &#8212; the horrified realisation
      struck her that she would almost certainly have had to come here, and try
      to drag this at least partly functional pilot to an Eva, probably through
      a fire-fight. And here she was, holding him, cradling his head against her
      breasts, and waiting, waiting, for something. What a sorry state to be in
      at the end of the world, clinging to an under-age kid, as the only warm
      body around, for all that he was no more active than a teddy bear, than a
      doll. A bleak fragment of a smile played on her lips &#8212; both the
      girls had rebelled in their own way against dolls, being dolls. The Third
      Child seemed to want to become one.</p>

    <p>Then there was something &#8212; a change in the quality of the light? A
      sound or cessation of sound? Then a whiteness, like morning sunlight
      through heavily frosted glass, approaching down the corridor. Silhouetted
      against the light, then illumined by it, Rei in the green school dress and
      white blouse that she had seen discarded in the elevator from Terminal
      Dogma, holding out her hand, a strange expression of concern on her face,
      the same as there had been on Yui Ikari's image.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I am your guide. Come, it is beginning.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;But what about&#8230;&#8221; But Shinji was no longer there.
      Everything was lost in the light.</p>

    <p>She reached out to the proffered hand. There was so much light.</p>

    <p>Misato Katsuragi closed her eyes for the last time.</p>

    <h2>Author's note (2004)</h2>

    <p>Having scorned TV since the late 80s, and thus <em xml:lang="la">a
        fortiori</em> never had a video player, it wasn't until <cite>Neon
        Genesis Evangelion</cite> came out on computer readable media &#8212; to
      wit, region 2 DVD &#8212; during late 2003 that I finally caught up with
      what many people have known about for the best part of a decade. Then,
      having watched the 26 episodes, by this March ('04) I ventured on to
      <cite>the End of Evangelion</cite>. That was definitely not the
      &#8220;what if it were a normal high-school mecha-pilot anime?&#8221; of
      the fragment in episode 26. It certainly had a strong impact on me. There
      were two reactions &#8212; that Shinji was even more of a jerk than is an
      unavoidable occupational hazard of being a 14-year&#8211;old boy, and that
      Asuka got a really raw deal in the end.
    </p>

    <p>This was something I wanted to work out of my system &#8212; that
      started out as an idle day-dream &#8212; how would Nancy Wolf, equipped as
      in <a href="index.html"><cite>Castles in the Sky</cite></a>, sort things
      out to save Asuka from being stuck alone with Shinji for all eternity,
      assuming that the unmodified trajectory of events would be episodes
      1&#8211;24 then <cite>End of</cite>. Surely she was outrageously powerful
      enough, had enough overkill, that she could arrange a happy ending for
      Asuka?
    </p>

    <p>But then, this is <cite>Evangelion</cite> we're talking about &#8212;
      it doesn't <em>do</em> happy endings &#8212; ambiguous ones maybe, but
      not happy. As I started to work through how as one person with finite,
      albeit large, resources, Nancy could act to change the outcome, things
      became less and less magic wand quick fix, with more constraints, more
      obstacles, more possibilities for narrative tension. And at that point
      I thought it became worth actually writing it out properly.</p>

    <p>Then events and characters took over &#8212; Asuka's use of the monitors
      was something I, as author, hadn't anticipated until I started detailing
      the scene where Nancy was only able to watch the battle against the Eva
      series from afar, a startling revelation to me as I cycled home. Nor had I
      anticipated &#8220;killing off&#8221; Nancy herself within that same
      scene, barely after the half-way stage of the narrative. I was surprised
      at the degree of unforced similarity between two independently invented
      characters such as Nancy (c.1975, UK) and Rei (c.1995, Japan), and played
      it up only slightly &#8212; by giving Nancy Rei's soft-spoken voice.</p>

    <p>This has also given me a chance to get out of my system some of the
      back-story from <cite>Castles in the Sky</cite> that I needed to have
      worked out, but none of the viewpoint characters had anything to do with
      &#8212; arrival, preliminary scouting, other process, as well as the
      enjoyable opportunity to revisit the characters of
      <cite>Evangelion</cite>, say how I finally came to see them, and carry
      them and the newcomer(s) forward, each, where possible, with their own
      distinct use of language in style and vocabulary. And the chance of trying
      my hand at the difficult task of carrying the narrative up to the point of
      the transition to the transhuman.

    <p>In a number of places, dialogue echoes or directly quotes from other
      sources, where this may enhance the reader's appreciation of sub-texts the
      annotation will show tool-tips (and in Mozilla, including Firefox, and
      other CSS compliant browsers &#8212; alas not IE, yet &#8212; these areas
      will show by fading slightly) when the mouse moves over them. Some is of
      course, given the nature of the source material, scriptural in origin, but
      there are other, more recent sources, taken as appropriate. The last
      sentence of the tale is also in this style, as an example.</p>

    <p>The rendition of Nancy's first language is as Ceqli, an actual modern-day
      synthetic language, details of which can be found at
      <a
        href="http://web.archive.org/web/20021009171818/http://www.geocities.com/ceqli/Uploadexp.htm">http://web.archive.org/web/20021009171818/http://www.geocities.com/ceqli/Uploadexp.htm</a>.
      There is a tool-tip for translation in the hint style. In order to achieve
      the Ceqli phrase that I wanted, <a href="empyrean.html">unlike in previous
        uses</a>, I needed to get a new word <cite xml:lang="x-ceqli"
        title="save, rescue (Irish)">
        taral</cite> added to its lexicon by its inventor. (Thanks, Rex!)
    </p>

    <p>And when she speaks that phrase, if it were an anime, that would be when
      the background music would cue <cite><a

    <p>Some of the nomenclature &#8212; Friendly, with a capital F, &#8220;hard
      take-off&#8221; and such &#8212; regarding the Singularity are taken from
      the terminology of the (Future) Shock Level 4 mailing list from
      <a href="http://www.sl4.org">sl4.org</a> and related Singularitarian
      haunts.
