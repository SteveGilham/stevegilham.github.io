    <p>&#8220;So here goes.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Nancy Wolf sat in what seemed an infinite blankness, the control analogue
      of the self-enfolding StarGate <cite>Secret Rose</cite>. She had launched the
      program that the Seraph had provided, the one that would open the wormhole to
      the past, by stitching together an astronomical &#8212; more than
      astronomical &#8212; number of pre-existing paths in the quantum foam, back
      by a Planck time or so at each step, and forcing them wide enough for the
      <cite>Secret Rose</cite> to pass. She was aiming for Earth, at the opening of
      the third millennium, well before the untamed Singularity that had taken most
      of the human race, well before the space industries that had left one of the
      most significant remnant populations, so that there could be a more orderly,
      and complete Transcension. But with the inherent uncertainties in the
      process, she was now scattering herself, one world-line at a time, across the
      whole of the past, across all space, across a whole range of alternates.

    <p>Most of her world-lines would cluster near her own past, near the date
      that she intended. But a small fraction would be wildly out. But if there was
      anything in that past that she could bring to Transcension, she would. The
      drive that had been built into her whole structure by the Ascended, via the
      genome fixes supplied to her Clan, now reinforced by &#8212; a glimpsed
      experience? propaganda? direct rewriting? &#8212; her visit to Earth, and
      the floating mountains where the Ascended maintained contact with this
      perspective on the Dust, that drive would only let her turn back if there was
      nothing that could be redeemed in this past.</p>

    <p>A darkness appeared in the view, a star filled globe. The far end of the
      journey, rushing towards her.</p>

    <p>At a gesture, the timbre of the Engines altered. No longer careering down
      the tunnel, but holding station, as she launched a first set of probes,
      almost dumb specks, with the size and processing power of midges, held in a
      loose array by a network of forbidden channel resonances.</p>

    <p>The imperceptible cloud dived up and out of the well, dispersing in all
      directions to give a wide aperture array. The signal took an imperceptible
      time to integrate, then replaced the local view. Annotated, it showed that
      she was barely in the right neck of the woods &#8212; 5AU out, well south of
      the ecliptic, and over a decade later than intended. So far, not too bad. The
      motes continued to disperse, increasing their integrated resolution, and
      scanning over a broader range of frequencies.</p>

    <p>Almost at once, anomalies started to show. Even given the unfavourable
      viewpoint dominated by the southern hemisphere, up into Asia, Earth was
      unexpectedly quiet in radio wavelengths, and the optical showed too much red
      in the spectrum. She started to worry about being in a really low-likelihood
      alternate past &#8212; a Stapledonian occupation of Antarctica by Wellsian
      Martians with their red weed maybe. The local Mars was reassuringly quiet in
      radio, so there could only be a few radio-mediated dispersed cloud-jelly
      consciousnesses within the spectral bounds.</p>

    <p>The integrated image zoomed in on the Earth, a bright speck growing into a
      clouded ball, mainly dark under the cloud, but with a reddish blotch
      spreading out of the night-side where Antarctica ought to be. Sliding into
      the near infra-red, land and sea showed through the cloud. The coastlines
      revealed showed a massive rise in sea level compatible with the melting of
      the southern ice, and that the oceans were unusually warm, though not enough
      for super-hurricanes to sustain. Reverting to visual, and integrating, on the
      night side, some city lights showed. In orbit, nothing significant.</p>

    <p>This place was going to be a mess, a seriously different history or both.
      But now she was committed.</p>

    <p>She let the Engines resume, and the <cite>Secret Rose</cite> settled the
      final distance to meet the worm-hole mouth and anchor it. That would radiate
      a significant amount of gravitational waves, and a lot of subtle particles
      &#8212; supersymmetric neutrino analogues, shadow matter particles, and
      gravitinos. It was unlikely that a technology of this era would be able to
      detect it. In any case, travelling at real-space speeds, the detection would
      be a distraction, an hour or so from now, after she had vacated this
      vicinity.</p>

    <p>The Engines roared again, and the gate, wormhole and all, dived under the
      surface of local spacetime, emerged again with the mass of the moon between
      it and Earth. Now with sensors over the whole 50 kilometer aperture of the
      ring engaged, she was certain, as soon as her meatware consciousness could
      absorb the data, that the whole farside was as dead as it had been for aeons
      past, no farside installations, human or alien, showing anything out of local
      thermodynamic equilibrium.</p>

    <p>One final rumble, and the Engines stilled. Their last rattling action had
      scattered a number of sensor packages &#8212; bigger, brighter, wasp-sized
      throughout cislunar space down into low Earth orbit, to sit, watch and wait,
      provide all the contextual information that she would need, and watch out for
      external interventions.</p>

    <p>Now the hard work would begin.</p>

    <p>Knowing that it would be a long time before she could again attend to the
      meat, she would call this a rest break &#8212; a last meal, purging of
      bladder and bowels, to acknowledge the flesh before she surrendered the
      chassis to mechanism.</p>

    <p>A floor appeared and so did local gravity. A reassuring illusion of
      windows between herself and the void beyond, the looming dark and dust-grey
      of the moon which drowned the stars in this authentic display. And a door,
      leading into windowless corridors, and then into a room scattered with
      couches and real windows.</p>

    <p>She called for a beer, long, blonde and cold, and selection of light
      savouries, pulled up a chair and sat, feet on table, sipping and nibbling,
      watching the moon slowly wheel past. In the background, gentle music,
      intricate and subtle. Deliberately, she turned her attention on her senses,
      and tried not to dwell too much on what now lay ahead, a broad telepathic
      scan of the entire planet, to find the pivotal individuals who she could
      recruit to her side &#8212; whether they bore any resemblance to the
      individuals she had expected to be working with.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Anomaly.&#8221; The automated systems &#8212; social insect
      level AIs &#8212; had found something that they felt required her personal
      intervention.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Display it here.&#8221;</p>

    <p>The ceiling turned from neutral into a display, corrected for her viewing
      angle, showing the limb of the Earth where dawn was rising over Arabia. And
      in low orbit, something that looked like insectile wings made out of white
      light.</p>

    <p>&#8220;What the dying&#8230;&#8221; she breathed the expletive, then in
      command voice &#8220;Relay this downstream. Get the Seraph, or failing that,
      the Linker archives, get an identification.&#8221;</p>

    <p>There was an delay of some tens of seconds, then a deep neutral voice
      spoke in her mind.</p>

    <p>&#8220;A Celestial. A pseudo-living artefact of some previous
      Transcension. Ascended investigations have reconstructed evidence that they
      were active on y/our Earth some tens of kiloyears ago, may have interacted
      with some of the last pre-humans, possibly causing a weak Transcension of
      some sort. Hypothesis &#8212; on this timeline, they stayed inert until
      recent historical times.&#8221;</p>

    <p>The voice of the archives fell silent, but this focus remained, she was
      sure, to record.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Oh, decrepitude! This is going to be a bitch.&#8221;</p>

    <p>The view briefly whited out, recovered as the central body at the focus of
      those wings of light activated itself in some fashion. In a reflex, Nancy
      felt shutters come down about her mind, while her body started to curl up,
      spilling food and drink. Conscious thought followed, slow as usual.</p>

    <p>Telepathic attack &#8212; but what she was sensing was merely the
      side-lobes, relayed through her sensor network, not at a level that could
      present any threat, especially with the regulators on the comms links. The
      main attack itself showed no finesse &#8212; there was a modulation that was
      spawning all sorts of less exotic radiation, mainly in the optical band or
      longer wavelength, enough to show the main lobe of the attack as a very
      narrow beam, maybe 25m across where it struck the Earth, somewhere in Japan,
      not too far from where, under a thick layer of cloud, Tokyo might have been.
      Aimed at an individual, or a small co-located group, she surmised.</p>

    <p>While it was pouring its energies Earthwards, and presumably was focussing
      what passed for attention there too, she cautiously steered her probe net to
      examine the construct. She didn't have Transcendent weaponry, the nearest
      being something geared towards defence and escape in the event of a bad
      take-off. Having to deal with something like that might be&#8230;</p>

    <p>Her thoughts were interrupted by a rush of positron-annihilation frequency
      gammas. Someone on Earth, not too far from the target of the telepathic
      attack, was fighting back with a particle beam weapon, but to no avail. The
      lacy, fractal structure of light continued its slow drift as the
      counter-attack splashed off the shielding surrounding the visible body.</p>

    <p>A part of her distributed net figuratively tapped her on the shoulder.
      There were human constructs &#8212; communications, surveillance and other
      types of satellite &#8212; in orbit, and a number were feeding views of this
      conflict along downlinks terminating near the earthbound end. This was going
      to be a place to be worth scanning later, when the dust had settled. And
      certainly a place to start her infiltration of the local internetwork
      infrastructure. She assigned a few dumb modules to that task and turned back
      to the main event.</p>

    <p>In the interim, it seemed that the guy downstairs had come to the
      conclusion that to continue with the beam weapon was futile &#8212; but not
      before Nancy had been able to gauge the effectiveness of the defence. A few
      sacrificial probes had measured the transmission rate of the positron beam,
      and by the time the results were presented to her they made reassuring
      reading. The beam had been within an order of magnitude of the flux density
      that would have been effective &#8212; and that would be within the
      capabilities of her own conventional weaponry to match, if the necessity
      arose.</p>

    <p>Minutes passed. The telepathic attack continued, though she cut off the
      relay from the probes so she didn't have to feel it in the background all the
      time. It would probably take some time for the necessary amounts of extra
      power to be brought on line to make an effective counter attack, she guessed.
      She could intervene &#8212; but without information, without context, she
      could not be sure what would be the right approach.</p>

    <p>And then it happened so fast she hardly caught it, only apprehended it on
      the replay. The Celestial unravelled in a burst of light, as something passed
      through it, elongated, deep red, somewhere between metal and ceramic in
      appearance. Vectors confirmed both that the launch point had been near the
      particle beam launch &#8212; and the centre of a sudden spreading clearing
      of the skies &#8212; and that having spent kinetic energy in passing through
      the shields and the target, that it would now swing around the moon like an
      Apollo, then, interacting with the definitely non-spherical lunar potential
      well, impact the surface. That would be in just over three days time. Plenty
      in which to manoeuvre the StarGate to intercept.</p>

    <p>A few probes had hazarded active scans of the object under the cover of
      the impact, and as the results were passed through the network, she became
      less happy. That was not an object of human manufacture this side of the
      Singularity. In some senses it wasn't even properly material, composed of
      forces and particles not normally bound into cohesive form.</p>

    <p>This was getting to be a less happy prospect as the data flowed in. She
      had planned primarily for the main run of history, where the main concern
      would be the uplift of Asia and Africa's pre-civic societies, with despots
      and fanatics simply located, and eradicated or redirected. She had made
      provision in the form of some armaments for the unlikely scenario of global
      high-tech war, and for desperate straits, she carried on-board under rigorous
      Seraphic security, the means to force a hard take-off if faced with the
      likely obliteration by other means of whichever strand of humanity she
      encountered. And her strategy for dealing with any imminent Transcension was
      to have been simply to jump aboard and get carried along for the ride.</p>

    <p>This had the makings of both at once. With turn of the millennium
      technology, and samples of Transcendent manufacture, a hard take-off of some
      form would be too easy to spring. The original timetable was out the window.
      She would need to ramp up the production of the monitor agents, and that
      would still take days. If she had days. Otherwise it would have to be all
      aboard for the magical mystery tour.</p>

    <p>She itched to take a telepathic scan of the Japan end of the battle, but
      didn't want to risk anything that close to the center of activity that was
      not purely passive observation just at the moment. She could make a
      surreptitious in-person visit, but if she was forced into disclosure, she
      would be lost without unsubtle amounts of back-up. So she would just have to
      contain herself, while the preparations were made. At least the mechanical
      parts of the operation could continue &#8212; infiltration of the local
      networks, even the highest level scanning of the populace for key
      individuals. Meanwhile she felt the need to acquire an idiomatic command of
      Japanese, to add to the English and Arabic she had already crammed.</p>

    <p>Forty-eight hours common elapsed interval later, she was back on
      downstream Mars, overseeing monitor production, and still struggling with the
      disorganization of her conscious thought processes as her co-processor added
      a running simultaneous translation of her ruminations into yet another
      language that sliced reality in its own idiosyncratic fashion, when an
      explosion levelled the city that had defended itself from the orbiting
      Celestial.</p>

    <p>It was time to turn some attention to this other Earth.</p>

    <p>Sighing, she left the autofac to churn out more units, and took the
      wormhole route back to the <cite>Secret Rose</cite>.</p>

    <p>The time had been enough for more worrying data to accumulate. There was a
      neutrino-opaque spherical structure of comparable size to the StarGate
      directly under the now destroyed city. Worse, that and a number of other
      locations around the globe were effectively screened from telepathic probing.
      <em>That</em> was bad. That was unexpected technology.
    </p>

    <p>Many of the significant individuals from the same epoch on canonical Earth
      were absent &#8212; some dead in the cataclysm that had wiped Antarctica
      away, a decade and a half earlier, others simply not present in this slightly
      different history. Those that were present were usually working on other
      things &#8212; many on projects helping to restore what had been lost in the
      turmoil. Others were working for a UN agency that was apparently at the
      centre of these anomalous events. That was where she would have to take over
      the trail, sniffing around where it vanished into the shielded areas.</p>

    <p>It took many days, time she feared she did not have. But eventually, by
      their effects on others, she found two clandestine factions &#8212; cabals,
      really &#8212; within that agency striving to use this fortuitous find of
      Transcendent creation to engineer their own Transcensions. One &#8212;
      notionally the upper command levels &#8212; was for promoting a hard
      take-off of the &#8220;kill them all and let God sort them out&#8221;
      school, reckless beyond belief. The other, the executive arm, based in the
      Japanese location, was striving more selfishly for apotheosis, hoping to drag
      everyone into some more exalted state.</p>

    <p>And both had Celestial level armaments.</p>

    <p>And things were coming to a head imminently.</p>

    <p>There would be a confrontation between the two cabals, that she could
      tell. And of the two, Japan seemed the least worst. So that would be how she
      would intervene.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Maya Ibuki stared, not really conscious of what she was looking at, at the
      terminal on her desk. Everyone around her was struck by the same general
      feeling of anti-climax . The last, the subtlest, Angel, had been destroyed.
      Their job was over &#8212; wasn't it? Soon she would have to think about
      what came next. Her never too clearly formulated plans to follow Ritsuko as
      her assistant into whatever corporate or academic research she would move on
      to were dashed by the fact that Ritsuko was now under arrest for some
      ill-defined act of sabotage against NERV. Perhaps she would have to join the
      general reconstruction efforts, if they were re-deployed under the UN.</p>

    <p>It took her some seconds to realise that they were being called to first
      stage alert &#8212; and that the MAGI systems were under attack, not as
      before from an Angel, but from their peers in the other remaining NERV
      subordinate branches &#8212; but training and experience had her responding
      to the attack, and giving status updates, as quickly as was humanly possible.
      If only Ritsuko were here. She would be better able to cope, to reconfigure
      those avatars of Naoko Akagi to defend themselves.</p>

    <p>As she settled herself down to work, she reflected how the quasi-sentient
      nature of the MAGI systems had changed this sort of security countermeasure
      work. They could not just drop the entire system off-line &#8212; not simply
      because it would render headquarters blind to the wider world, but because it
      would inflict unacceptable trauma on the MAGI, just as an amputation would
      affect a human being. But the attacks were not the simple buffer overruns of
      a decade or more earlier, but conducted at a more human pace, in a more human
      style, to subvert a system in ways that were akin to subverting a human
      intellect.</p>

    <p>She was deep into flow when she heard a cheer go up around her. The
      Commander was escorting Ritsuko onto the command level. She did not know what
      had happened, but it was clear from their body language that neither wanted
      to be in the same room together.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Good work, Maya,&#8221; Ritsuko said, as she looked over her
      shoulder, while picking her own laptop from the next desk, &#8220;Now please
      open the access hatch for Caspar.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Yes, ma'am!&#8221; She let herself feel that things might just be
      going to turn out all right. With that reassurance, she turned back to
      coding, feeling that all was going well.</p>

    <p>The relentless pressure of the attack stepped up, but with Ritsuko there,
      it seemed that the march of red subversion markers across the status display
      was being slowed.</p>

    <p>And then it happened.</p>

    <p>One subsystem flipped from red to grey. Grey!? And then in a cascade, it
      wiped both other colours from the board. Her terminal locked up &#8212; and
      so it seemed had all the rest.</p>

    <p>In the sudden astonished silence, everyone could hear Ritsuko's anguished
      howl &#8220;Mother!&#8221;</p>

    <p>Then a new female voice on the speakers.</p>

    <p>&#8220;System Harmony on-line. MAGI virtualization complete.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;System Rhapsody on-line. MAGI virtualization complete.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;System Destiny on-line. MAGI virtualization complete.&#8221;</p>

    <p>The status display refreshed. Each of the three main MAGUS boxes had been
      relabelled. And inside each were three smaller boxes labelled as the original
      MAGI. In two of the systems, all the inner MAGI were green, but in Harmony,
      the outward facing node, the red showed as it had before the interruption. It
      seemed that the whole attack was being directed at the one node, and it was
      reacting as if they were still defending against the attack.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Status report.&#8221; The Commander was abrupt as usual.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I think someone is amusing themselves at our expense,&#8221;
      Shigeru volunteered, &#8220;Those names are from <span class="hint"
        title="Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons - A Gerry (Thunderbirds) Anderson puppet show from the late '60s">British
        television, nearly fifty years ago</span>. Fighter pilots, code named
      Angels.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;All systems appear normal when running on the two inner nodes. The
      outer node is acting as a honey-pot,&#8221; Makoto added the pertinent
      facts.</p>

    <p>&#8220;So a new player has entered the game.&#8221; The Commander seemed
      almost pleased. &#8220;Well, let us see what their next move will
      be.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Massive energy release directly overhead! Altitude 10,000. It's
      fifty kilometers across.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Outside view.&#8221;</p>

    <p>The main screen cleared of the default tactical display, showed an
      external camera looking up. Clouds were coming into being, alive with
      lightning, and then suddenly cleared, to show a moon in a dark sky, a moon
      too close, a sky too dark for a normal morning. And then the usual sky
      returned, with a band of bright metal floating in the sunlight. Darkness
      drifted down from it, like rain seen from a distant cloud, and lances of
      light struck the earth, raising explosions.</p>

    <p>A number of external cameras suddenly failed. In other views, there were
      glimpses of black clad, masked figures, and black capsules, with bright
      yellow blazes, floating in pursuit.</p>

    <p>The new voice of what had been the MAGI spoke again.</p>

    <p>&#8220;This facility is under attack from elements of the JSSDF including
      special forces units. We are being defended. Some special force units have
      penetrated the outer facilities, but will shortly be neutralized by allied
      monitor units.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Strong AT field detected!&#8221; Makoto again. He paused, waiting
      for more information to come in. &#8220;Analysing&#8230; pattern&#8230;
      pattern is Grey!?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Is it another Angel?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;It's at least as human as Kaworu was. But the pattern is definitely
      not Blue, repeat, <em>negative</em> on Blue.</p>

    <p>&#8220;It's inside the geofront. It's headed here. 100 meters&#8230; 50
      meters&#8230;It's here.&#8221;</p>

    <p>He leapt up, pointing at one of the emergency egress shafts. A small
      figure drifted down into sight. For a moment, Maya thought that it might be
      Rei &#8212; the same slight figure, the same blue-greyish hair. But pale
      though the First Child might be, she did not have the literally ashen pallor,
      skin the colour of wood ash, that this one had.</p>

    <div class="hide" style="float:right;">
      <div style="padding:5px;border: black 1px solid;text-align: center;background-color: #eee;color:inherit">
        <img height="512" width="512" src="00004-767301463.webp" alt="Nancy arrives at NERV" />
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>And what at first had seemed perhaps the white of Rei's plug suit resolved
      into a white jacket over a blue leotard, and high white boots.</p>

    <p>&#8220;That's&#8230;&#8221; Shigeru began.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I recognise the reference, Mr.Aoba,&#8221; the Commander spoke
      dryly, &#8220;<span class="hint" title="Lovely Angel Yuri (Dirty Pair Flash)">Another Angel</span>.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;We are now under siege.&#8221; The newcomer spoke, and despite
      its amplification, the voice sounded like Rei's, the same flat affect.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the Commander, &#8220;the old men have made
      their move. And from the fact that I am still alive, I deduce that you have
      chosen to stand with me on this matter, Miss&#8230;?&#8221;</p>

    <p>The figure drifted towards the Commander, followed by a group of
      blue-on-white capsules.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I am Nancy, Lady Wolf. But I think the name, the associations
      would better translate as <em>Kitsune</em>. Yes, call me Kitsune,
      Ikari-san.</p>

    <p>&#8220;And we stand together now only because their plan is much, much
      the worse. Launching a Transcension is always a hazardous matter. Theirs
      would be reckless beyond all contemplation.</p>

    <p>&#8220;For the moment I have bought us some time. I can hold off
      conventional armaments, even nuclear weapons, indefinitely, but your enemies
      have launched their Transcendent weapons. I can destroy their delivery
      systems, but when those weapons arrive I shall have to withdraw the
      StarGate.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I suggest that you ready your own Transcendent devices.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Yes. The Evangelions.&#8221;</p>

    <p>The Commander lifted his head from where he had been cradling it in his
      hands, a grim smile upon his face. &#8220;Pilot status?&#8221; he
      called.</p>

    <p>Maya called up the appropriate search. Rei &#8212; Rei's whereabouts were
      not showing. &#8220;Rei is&#8230;&#8221; missing, she was about to say.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I am here.&#8221; The quiet voice sounded from the back of the
      deck. The First Child was standing there, wearing her usual school outfit,
      hands held limply by her sides.</p>

    <p>The newcomer, Kitsune, drifted down, alighted on the floor behind where
      Maya was sitting, and she turned to watch the confrontation.</p>

    <p>Kitsune and Rei just looked at each other.</p>

    <p>&#8220;You and I, we are very much alike.&#8221;</p>

    <p>She could not tell which of the two had spoken.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Nancy watched the strange girl who looked very much like she did. Even
      without probing, she could feel a strong telepathic shield about her. From
      his reactions, disguised though they might be, Gendo Ikari clearly felt that
      this was his agent, perhaps his closest ally, certainly his most loyal
      follower. And Ikari was a very, very subtle and intelligent man &#8212; an
      ally of convenience and no further. And no longer entirely human.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Continue,&#8221; she acknowledged that the staring match had
      interrupted Maya's report.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Asuka is still hospitalised &#8212; room 303. And Shinji is on
      level 3, just sitting in one of the corridors.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I do not know if I shall be able to pilot an Eva. Unit 01 rejected
      me, and I do not know if Unit 02 will accept me,&#8221; the quiet girl
      &#8212; Rei &#8212; stated, distantly.</p>

    <p>The exchange brought a lot more useful data into near verbal form, easy to
      read, a briefing that gave her the first substantial data to fill the gap she
      had been edging up towards for the recent weeks. It made depressing reading.
      The enigma here in front of her seemed fit, but could not pilot. The two
      other pilots, both children, were severely traumatized, according to their
      collected accounts &#8212; and a brief scan, jumping from mind to mind to
      find the children, confirmed it. There was something suspect about
      one of the two deployable units. And their were gaps in the deployment
      technology for the other. She verbalised her surprise and shock.</p>

    <p>&#8220;You have to power the thing, Unit 02, remotely? You have all these
      &#8212; these technologies,&#8221; she waved her hand vaguely to indicate
      the whole underground complex, which her accompanying monitors were slowly
      building up a comprehensive picture of, &#8220;and you don't have fusion?
      You're still using copper? You should at least have warm superconductors by
      now, surely. And you don't have a pilot who's fit?</p>

    <p>&#8220;Oh, well. Those problems are on a scale I can assist with.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Doctor Akagi &#8212; please take this monitor unit with you to
      Unit 02. I shall deliver a power plant and a fabber to retrofit it. Replacing
      the existing batteries or as a plug-in as you feel best.&#8221; She
      gestured, and one of the blue-striped white capsules drifted towards Ritsuko.
      &#8220;It will follow you. It has a natural language interface so you can
      tell it your design decision.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Major Katsuragi &#8212; please take me to Ms Soryu. Unit 02 needs
      a pilot. I will see what I can do to help her.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Meanwhile, I suspect it would be unwise to use Unit 01 under these
      circumstances &#8212; is that not so, Commander?&#8221;</p>

    <p>Gendo Ikari just stared at her, but did not deny the assertion.</p>

    <p>&#8220;And Commander, I suggest that you not attempt to precipitate
      anything unless we are about to be defeated anyway, despite our combined
      efforts. I came from an alternate future where a different type of Human
      Complement Program took place, under very different circumstances. I have
      learned its lessons, and I returned to the past to endeavour to ensure that
      things turn out right this time. Even if this isn't the past I was aiming
      for.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Nancy looked at Misato, nodded.</p>

    <p>&#8220;This way,&#8221; she indicated, and headed towards the lift
      platform where Rei still stood. Nancy followed.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I shall accompany you.&#8221; Rei stated the fact made obvious by
      not moving as Nancy and Misato joined her.</p>

    <p>As they rode the platform, Nancy shifted her outfit. By the time the lift
      halted, she was wearing urban camo trousers, comfortable dark grey boots and
      a silver-grey tank top.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Your&#8230;&#8221; Misato noticed the change.</p>

    <p>&#8220;This is more comfortable. The original display was fine for its
      amusement value, tweaking Gendo Ikari's nose, but if there is walking
      involved, I would rather do it without heels.&#8221;</p>

    <p>The three walked, and rode lifts, in near silence. Misato tried to banter,
      but soon gave up. Rei, it was apparent, was not a conversationalist, and
      Nancy herself was trying to supervise many different threads that she
      couldn't leave entirely to unattended mechanisms. While her monitors had
      neutralized the special forces incursions into the base, and now maintained a
      perimeter with distorts that would keep unshielded humans away, it would not
      be too much longer until the nine approaching aircraft with their ominous
      cargoes came within range of her main weapons, and would be shot down. Those
      would be the first shots of the final battle. And there was the other pilot
      to scan, check out, remotely, in case he might interfere, and dispatch
      monitors to guard.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Here.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Misato placed her hand on the doorknob, about to open the door, when Nancy
      asked &#8220;Why do you trust me, Major Katsuragi?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Because&#8230; Because you have asked, rather than taken by force
      when you could have. And because I think you are intending to stop his scheme
      as well&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;And are you acting of your own free will?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I'm here because you asked. Or are you asking something
      else?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;In every world-line I make a different choice. I don't know if
      that is free will or not.&#8221;</p>

    <p>They stepped into a bare, clinical room, where a teenage girl lay sprawled
      on a bed, surrounded by quietly beeping medical gear.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Catatonia, after physical and mental trauma&#8221; Misato
      explained.</p>

    <div class="hide" style="float:right;">
      <div style="padding:5px;border: black 1px solid;text-align: center;background-color: #eee;color:inherit">
        <img height="512" width="512" src="00008-410584643.webp" alt="Nancy at Asuka's bedside" />
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>Nancy approached the bed. She reached out her left hand, and stroked the
      girl's hair. At the same time, with the physical contact as a guide, she
      touched the girl's mind, and found it red raw with trauma. Some of the scars
      were old, from infancy. Others very recent. This untrained, unguarded mind
      had borne the brunt of the Angel's attack &#8212; it was surprising that she
      had not fallen into this state at once, that it had taken something else to
      finally tip her into the abyss.</p>

    <p>Her hand running through the red hair became the metaphor she used to work
      on the girl's damaged psyche. Some was like combing out tangles, gently
      teasing them out. But others she could do nothing about, save to cut them out
      &#8212; and that in itself would be more damage. Now, alas, was no time for
      regrets, for long drawn out delicate work. She did what was least worst to
      try and rebuild the girl's self-image, awaken the fires that had burned so
      low. If they were lucky, there would be time later for her to heal
      properly.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Wake up, Asuka,&#8221; she whispered, &#8220;We need
      you.&#8221;</p>

    <p>The girl's eyes flickered open, focussed.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Oh, it's you, wonder-girl. Go 'way.&#8221; and she rolled over.
      &#8220;Bitch!&#8221; she muttered under her breath.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Asuka!&#8221; Misato's delight at hearing any response was
      undisguised.</p>

    <p>At the sound of her voice, Asuka opened her eyes again, turned to look at
      Misato, and spotted Rei standing impassively by the door, looked up at Nancy,
      the two monitors hovering behind her, then back and forth a few times.</p>

    <p>&#8220;You're not wonder-girl. Who are you?&#8221;</p>

    <p>And then memory. She sat up abruptly, pulling free from various
      electrodes, her pajama jacket tugged open by the wires.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Where's that bastard Shinji. Did he..? Am I..?&#8221;</p>

    <p>Nancy focussed the subtle senses of the monitors, checking the girl from
      head to toe.</p>

    <p>&#8220;No, you're just fine. I'm Kitsune, I'm here to help. Now, we have
      a challenge for you.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Asuka cocked her head, a half smile on her face.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Asuka,&#8221; Misato stepped forwards, &#8220;Asuka, we need you
      to destroy the rest of the Eva series.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Why don't you ask Shinji the fucking hero. He can still pilot
      <em>his</em> Eva. Or wonder-girl there,&#8221; she pointed with her chin,
      &#8220;Kitsune, Misato can tell you &#8212; my synch ratio is
      zero.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Unit 00 is destroyed. And no-one else has synchronized to your
      Unit 02,&#8221; Rei stated.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Pilot Ikari is digging himself into the same sort of fugue state
      you were in. And for the moment, that's probably the safest place for him to
      be. For all our sakes,&#8221; and Nancy hoped that no-one else found out
      quite what was at stake, what Gendo Ikari's startlement had almost verbally
      blurted out to her, and what his son's mental state would mean in that
      eventuality, until later, after the crisis, &#8220;Now, go and surprise
      us.&#8221; And she gave a final psychic nudge along with the words.</p>

    <p>The girl broke into a wicked grin. &#8220;OK, foxy lady. Try me. Now, get
      me a plug-suit.&#8221;</p>
    <hr />

    <p>&#8220;What did she mean about Shinji?&#8221; Misato asked while they
      waited in the corridor for Asuka to dress.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Your other pilot attacked her. She wanted to know if he had gone
      further than common assault after she blacked out. And to answer your next
      question, yes, I can read minds.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Misato's face suddenly reddened.</p>

    <p>&#8220;After a while, everyone's own little secrets just blur into a
      mass. It gets old quick, playing the peeping tom. It <em>is</em> useful to
      pull extra bandwidth in conversation by picking up the unspoken contexts. But
      that is also why I asked those questions before.</p>

    <p>&#8220;So he told you that Asuka had gone wild and then collapsed when he
      tried to restrain her, when it was he who lost it. Death! Do you have to be
      damaged to do this job or does it just happen naturally?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;The children have to have been born after the Second Impact, and
      have lost their mothers. Isn't that enough? And we had to find children like
      that and send them out to be our front line soldiers. Or they have to be like
      Rei&#8230;&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Imperfect replicas of a dead woman. Like me.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;If I am a monster, then whose fault is it but my
      creator's?&#8221; Rei asked.</p>

    <p>The ward door opened, and Asuka stepped out.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Is the world ready for this?&#8221; she asked, spreading her arms
      wide, then, noticing the atmosphere, &#8220;Am I interrupting
      something?&#8221;</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Another elevator cage, cramped, descending through open darkness, with
      occasional red lights. They travelled in silence, with Asuka staying in the
      opposite corner to where Rei had planted herself, an obvious tension between
      the two &#8212; or at least on Asuka's part, something that hadn't been
      resolved by the butchery Nancy had perpetrated in lieu of careful psychic
      surgery.</p>

    <div class="hide" style="float:right;">
      <div style="padding:5px;border: black 1px solid;text-align: center;background-color: #eee;color:inherit">
        <img height="512" width="512" src="00007-1629588053.webp" alt="Asuka and Nancy head for the loading bay" />
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>&#8220;<span xml:lang="de">Mein Gott</span>!&#8221; Asuka broke the
      tension, &#8220;I can feel Unit 02. It's like I'm synchronized.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;That is because you are.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;But, Kitsune, how?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Because you have now awakened,&#8221; and she switched into
      English to misquote, &#8220;&#8216;Cometh the hour, cometh the
      woman&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

    <p>And at that moment, they descended into light, a vast hangar where a
      bright scarlet giant humanoid form was cradled in a network of catwalks.
      Amongst all the workers, Ritsuko Akagi's blonde hair and white lab-coat stood
      out, where she was supervising as a large armour plate was being fixed into
      place in the middle of the Eva's back.</p>

    <p>&#8220;It's different. You've&#8230; Where's the umbilical going to
      go?&#8221; Asuka spotted where the work was taking place.</p>

    <p>Nancy smiled at her. &#8220;We've made some changes. You'll see.&#8221;
      she said.</p>

    <p>The cage rattled to a halt, and the doors opened. Asuka was first out,
      running along the catwalk towards Ritsuko, waving. Misato just stared at her,
      an expression of deep hurt on her face. &#8220;She's not been like that for
      weeks. Can she keep it up?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;She's young. If there is time, she will heal.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Time? You think she'll die out there?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;It is not inconceivable. And there are other forces in
      motion.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Ikari?&#8221;</p>

    <p>Nancy nodded.</p>

    <p>&#8220;He can do nothing without me.&#8221; Rei added.</p>

    <p>Nancy turned to the girl, raised one eyebrow in question. But Rei was just
      staring blankly into the distance as she walked. And screened as she was, she
      was leaking nothing interesting on any band, not even to tell whether she was
      even aware of the gesture.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I am not his doll. The other one would have been.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Nancy could not be sure if that was intended as a continuation of the
      previous statement. There was something there, something that she was sure
      had to be important. But there was not the time to follow it up now. Nine
      targets were now acquired, were in range. She passed the command to fire back
      along the relay chain. High above, magnets realigned in the ring's massdriver
      chain, and nine clusters of kinetic kill weapons with significantly
      relativistic velocities tore through the atmosphere. She knew it would only
      cause delay, and not prevent the final onslaught, just as the earlier erasure
      of the SEELE cabal had not prevented the continued execution of their plans
      that had long been in motion.</p>

    <p>Two more commands, one to flip the <cite>Secret Rose</cite> half a world
      away, and the last to arm the ultimate resort, her own hard take-off
      capabilities, to fight fire with fire at the bitter end. Though she had not
      doubted it would, the acknowledgement that the last command had been received
      and acted upon were salutary. Even the Seraphim concurred with her
      analysis.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Kitsune! Kitsune?!&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I'm sorry, Major,&#8221; Nancy refocussed herself back into her
      own flesh, &#8220;I'm only post-human. There's a limit to the number of
      things I can work on in parallel.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I've done what I can about the other Evangelions. Now it's all up
      to our Pilot Soryu.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Misato nodded in acknowledgement. &#8220;Asuka, time to get you
      prepped,&#8221; she called the girl, and led her away.</p>

    <p>&#8220;And I owe you an apology too, Dr. Akagi. You are only here because
      I compelled you to be. And I'm afraid I have another task for you.&#8221;</p>

    <p>The woman looked down at her, waiting.</p>

    <p>&#8220;You must stop Ikari reaching Unit 01. By any means
      necessary.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Ritsuko's eyes widened in shock.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Which&#8230;?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Either of them. The father could not hide the fact that that
      construct is capital-S Significant in his plans. And as for the son, well, I
      would rather have someone mentally competent at the helm of such a
      weapon.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I planned to kill Gendo anyway, for what he did to me, to my
      mother, but&#8230;&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Don't worry. The virtualized systems were taken as exact replicas
      of the MAGI state. Whatever of her resides in the MAGI engrams is now
      triplicated.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Ritsuko waved the remark away.</p>

    <p>&#8220;No, not that. I see what you did &#8212; it was impressive. I
      don't bear you any animosity for that, though I did have a shock. I had been
      in the process of hacking a back door into the self-destruct system so I
      could be sure I could stop him, take him and this whole rotten edifice down
      with me. But I think that you are here to do that job &#8212; aren't
      you?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;To save the world. Yes, that is why I am here. I only hope that I
      have the resources.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Dr. Akagi &#8212; I must ask you. Do you fear
      transcendence?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;The secret goal of the Human Instrumentality Project? As I fear
      any involuntary transformation of self. At best it would be like growing up.
      And adolescence was&#8230; a painful time. We have no guarantees here that
      what develops would be Friendly.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;So if it can be done with Love?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;That might be better &#8212; but the Commander, he is beyond
      madness. He makes Oedipus look underambitious. <span class="hint"
        title="Description stolen from Robert Anton Wilson's 'Illuminatus!'  and scriptually enhanced">He
        wants to replace God and possess the Universe. And he would crucify his only
        begotten son to do so.</span></p>

    <p>&#8220;But Shinji&#8230;&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Has only ever shown you his public face. Look.&#8221; And she
      grabbed the clotted memory she had taken from Asuka, threw it in Ritsuko's
      face, watched her hands rise to her throat to struggle with the recollection
      of strangulation. &#8220;Do you want that in the most dangerous of
      humankind's creations?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;So Asuka was&#8230; I guess the apple doesn't fall far from the
      tree. Very well. I will do what I have to.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;If you would rather, I can instruct the fabber to provide you with
      a non-lethal weapon.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Ritsuko lowered her gaze, no longer willing to meet Nancy's, shook her
      head.</p>

    <p>&#8220;If Gendo comes here, I have to be able to kill him. But I suspect
      that he will be heading beneath Terminal Dogma, to Adam.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Subtext radiated out along with the remark. Geography, the way she needed
      to go, the nomenclature &#8212; they named the lower depths of this place
      from Dante.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Stay here. Do not hesitate to shoot when you see your target. And
      I shall be waiting for him in Ca&iuml;na in your stead.&#8221; Traitor's hell. It
      seemed appropriate.</p>

    <p>&#8220;We're ready to start the launch of Unit 02,&#8221; Misato called,
      from across the hangar &#8220;Time to clear the decks.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;So. Unit 01, then,&#8221; Ritsuko patted the pocket that Nancy
      knew carried a pistol. &#8220;Thank you, Kitsune, whoever you are. You may
      have brought us hope.&#8221; And she walked away, head held high, certain,
      even hoping, that her own death was imminent.</p>

    <p>&#8220;We should be in the launch control room.&#8221; Rei stated, and
      walked off to where Misato had been, Nancy following her.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>From behind heavy armoured glass, they watched the entry plug being
      inserted into the spine of Unit 02, and then all the surrounding structures
      withdrawn, Nancy and Rei as spectators where Misato was leading the
      operations.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Where's Ritsuko?&#8221; she asked during a brief pause.</p>

    <p>&#8220;With Unit 01. In case the worst happens.&#8221;</p>

    <p>In the background, the checklist continued.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Approaching absolute borderline in
      1.0&#8230;0.7&#8230;0.5&#8230;0.3&#8230;0.1. Synchronization established.
      25&#8230; 60&#8230; 100&#8230; 140&#8230; peaking at 161%.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Pilot synchronization stable at 161%.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;That's a record,&#8221; Misato told them, then on the intercom,
      &#8220;Looking good, Asuka!&#8221;</p>

    <p>On the capsule monitor screen, the pilot raised one hand to give a V for
      victory salute, a gesture mimicked by the Evangelion.</p>

    <p>&#8220;She's not even touching the controls.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;That's what 150+% synch looks like.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;OK, Asuka, here's the latest sit rep.&#8221; Nancy leant
      forwards, interrupting the technical chatter. &#8220;What I can tell you is
      that the nine units approaching us are white, have their own independent
      power sources, have flight capability, and they are carrying devices made
      from the same fake matter as the projectile that was launched from here
      against the 15<sup>th</sup> Angel.&#8221; The one that had been silently and
      immediately consumed by the Lagrange Clouds when it had reached the
      downstream end of the wormhole. The one that was clearly bad transhuman
      juju.</p>

    <p>&#8220;The good news is that you also have independent power and aerial
      capability. Plus you're patched in to my tactical net, and you have three
      billion monitors at your disposal, for all the good they'll do.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;And twelve thousand armour plates and my AT field.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Nancy nodded. Then, switching back to her first language, so that no-one
      else here would understand the desperate plea &#8220; <span xml:lang="x-ceqli" class="hint"
        title="Go save us, Red Woman, go save us all.">Ja taral gozi, Hoqxi, ja taral
        gozikul.</span>&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Unit 02 &#8212; launch!&#8221; Electrics crackled, and hummed as
      the linear drive took the red figure up and out of sight.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Three billion?&#8221; Misato asked.</p>

    <p>&#8220;They were intended to be mediating units assigned one to each
      person. They have a peacekeeping &#8212; peace making &#8212; function.
      They are monitors in the strict cybernetic sense. I've kept a few million
      back in case the JSSDF recover from their current attack of common sense and
      restart their offensive, and a few thousand for final defense of geofront
      personnel. I have other assets deployed for dealing with ballistic and cruise
      missile attacks. But the bulk of them are now Asuka's.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Unit 02 &#8212; deployed. Weapon systems &#8212;
      deployed.&#8221;</p>

    <p>External cameras now showed the red unit standing in broken woodland,
      surrounded by a major arsenal of appropriately scaled weapons.</p>

    <p>Nancy leaned over the console again.</p>

    <p>&#8220;You can feel the network?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Yes, Kitsune. This is awesome.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;You go, girl,&#8221; she called, &#8220;I have another battle to
      fight, but Major Katsuragi will be here.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Kitsune?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Thank you. I had forgotten what this was like.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;<span class="hint" title="Gratutious 'Plan 9 from Outer Space' allusion.">Watch the
        skies</span>, now. We can talk afterwards.&#8221;</p>

    <p>And she smiled while she said that, though she could not be sure that
      there would be an afterwards. But of those players who counted, she was sure
      that there was a tacit understanding that failure was not, could not be, an
      option. She had done all she could to counter SEELE's legacy. Now for
      NERV's.</p>

    <p>&#8220;It is time.&#8221; Rei spoke the words that Nancy was in the
      process of framing. Time for the confrontation with Ikari, she had meant. But
      what had Rei meant? The girl just looked impassively at her, then at the
      door, and began to walk.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>They were miles down now, descending in a small cage inside a set of
      intertwined spirals, in a cavern that was hundreds of meters across and
      deeper. There was no feeling of the Earth's tectonic heat despite the depth.
      A small part of Nancy wondered where this whole enigmatic shell had been in
      her history, which subtle chaotic drift of mantle convection current had
      taken it, and where. Had it breached the surface in one of the
      super-eruptions some tens of kiloyears before &#8212; Lake Taupo, perhaps?
      And how old was it? There was no easy way to date it &#8212; it could be as
      old as the Gardeners, that first hinted wave of Mind, whose traces were
      inferred from the sharing of deep idiosyncrasies of biochemistry across the
      galaxy.</p>

    <p>More of her watched the battle that raged above, a battle that was
      unfolding in a different way to how she had anticipated.</p>

    <p>When the Eva series had arrived, converging in a spiral, like soaring
      birds, then committing to land in a circle, maybe a kilometer across
      surrounding Unit 02, Asuka had taken up her artillery. Guided by the tactical
      net, the missiles impelled by her driving will, she had taken each one before
      it made the final stalling descent to zero altitude, zero velocity.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Nine birds down.&#8221; Makoto Hyuga, in the main control
      center.</p>

    <p>&#8220;What a bunch of wusses!&#8221; Asuku Langley Soryu, in Unit
      02.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Wait!&#8221; Misato Katsuragi, launch control.</p>

    <p>&#8220;They&#8230; The Eva series are reactivating!&#8221; Maya Ibuki,
      main control.</p>

    <p>Torn armour flowed together. Severed limbs, held in place, reattached. A
      flurry of fire had expended all Asuka's ammunition, slowing, but not halting
      the process. And one of the white units hauled itself to its feet, and flung
      its double ended blade at Unit 02.</p>

    <p>In response, a swarm of monitors arose from the trees, their autonomous
      programs responding with the default &#8220;Take the bullet.&#8221;
      reaction. The weapon flowed as it flew, forming into another of those red
      spiral forks. It penetrated the self-sacrificing monitors as if they were
      hardly there. But it interacted well enough with normal matter, that the
      sheer flux of transverse momentum deflected its flight.</p>

    <p>And Asuka plucked it from the air as it passed by her.</p>

    <p>And then the revelation.</p>

    <p>Nancy had discounted the monitors, their human scale weapons each as
      ineffective against an Eva as a midge against a battleship, even all
      assembled. But Asuka had seen them anew, seen the collective swarming action,
      a use that she, their forger, had not considered. Each unit could signal,
      could speak a warning, could communicate over a wide range of frequencies.</p>

    <p>In moments, the whole space of the conflict was a whirling storm of
      monitors, scarlet and black patterns sliding over their surfaces, a screaming
      maelstrom across the spectra &#8212; both audio and electromagnetic. She was
      using them as chaff, as flares, as fog. And for Asuka, that fog was
      Argus-eyed.</p>

    <p>Under its aegis, she pounced on the nearest enemy unit, a red blade in her
      hand, and began the work.</p>

    <p>Each of the white units was alone not a match for her, even in twos,
      sometimes threes, and soon she had both sword and shield, but so far only one
      of her opponents seemed to be down and staying down. Monitor losses were
      acceptable &#8212; only a few thousand so far, but the battle would be one
      of attrition, a race between Asuka's endurance and her ability to find
      something critical to destroy in the others.</p>

    <p>And then the relay cut, her awareness shrinking down to the inside of the
      elevator cage. But now she could feel the other mind here with her, could
      feel that the First Child had expanded her own screens to enclose them both,
      turning saw that the girl had undressed, her school uniform neatly folded on
      the floor, her skin flawless ivory, even to the nipples, and hairless.</p>

    <p>&#8220;You have come,&#8221; Rei whispered, &#8220;<span class="hint"
        title="cf. Frodo's declaration at Orodruin (omitted from the film)">But do
        you choose now to do what you came to do?</span></p>

    <p>&#8220;Do you want to be one with me, of one mind and body and soul? It
      would be what you had always desired.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Nancy remembered Ritsuko Akagi's words, of the fear of the involuntary
      transformation of the self. And yet had she not set out on this project, this
      quest for <span class="hint" title="Greek for 'the good life' - and a topic worth Googling on">eudaimonia</span>,
      with the intent of immersing herself inside something finer, seeking the
      ego-null feeling of flow for now and forever, world without end? Had that not
      been the goal deep inside herself when, all those decades ago, her feet had
      been set on this path, or even before that, if she could trust her imperfect
      meatware memories? Yet, as she had asked Major Katsuragi, how could she tell
      if this was her true will or not? And even if it was so, how could she know
      what form the Telos would take?</p>

    <p>Now, inside her shields, she could see what place the First Child had
      within Gendo Ikari's schemes.</p>

    <p>&#8220;You are the Catalyst.&#8221; Nancy could not tell if that was
      spoken or whether she merely projected the thought.</p>

    <p>&#8220;And you also.&#8221; Now she could see that this was what Rei had
      meant by her assertion that they were alike, more than their superficial
      likeness of physical form, more than their shared manner of creation.</p>

    <p>She knew what must be done. This was the final leap of faith, the point of
      no return. This was where she found the meaning that justified her existence.
      Her outfit flowed, contracted, resolved into a silver block embedded in her
      right wrist, set with a deep blue gem. Then that too fell away.</p>

    <p>Rei held up her right hand. Nancy looked into her face, almost as in a
      mirror, save that the other's skin was coloured with haemoglobin and melanin,
      was not grey, and the eyes that met her gaze were red, not silver. Her mouth
      dry, her heart pounding, she held her left hand up to match. Their palms
      touched, merged. Nancy felt the tissues flow as they did when she let the
      wolf take over, but now they were mingled with another's though without any
      feeling of alien flesh being rejected. Now the other hand. And then the final
      step.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>In launch control, the pilot monitor station, Misato was feeling out of
      the loop on everything that counted.</p>

    <p>In the early stages of the battle, she had felt that she had to be there
      for Asuka, even if all the support she could give was moral. There had been
      the too easy shooting down of the Evas, and their reactivation, while Asuka
      grimly mowed them down again, leaning forwards over the controls, smiling the
      familiar humourless smile from earlier, happier, days. Then something had
      happened, a movement she hadn't caught, and Asuka's synch ratio had spiked
      above 250%, held for a few seconds, before dropping back to just over 200%.
      At the same time all the external monitors had become blind. All she had was
      the Unit 02 telemetry, showing Asuka now lying back, eyes half closed,
      unfocussed, a slight frown on her face, her hands and fingers twitching
      slightly at the controls, as if she were asleep, and dreaming deeply. The
      fact that Asuka was immersed in LCL meant that Misato couldn't see whether
      the girl was drooling.</p>

    <p>Occasionally she spoke, in a disconnected voice, as if she was channeling
      something, or that the flesh was just an insignificant part of the whole. The
      only good news seemed to be in the content of these laconic messages that
      came at intervals of several minutes.</p>

    <p>&#8220;One target may be down.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Two possible kills. Three disarmed.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Three probable kills. Five disarmed.&#8221;</p>

    <p>The battle was not won yet, but there was nothing else that she &#8212;
      that anything human &#8212; could do. But there was something else she could
      be achieving &#8212; following the trail of Kaji's bequest, to find out what
      the hell was going on, what the real secrets were that her father had died to
      uncover, that had spawned Gehirn, and now NERV, what it was that Gendo Ikari
      had planned for the Angel imprisoned in the lowest levels of the geofront.
      And maybe even what this mysterious newcomer intended.</p>

    <p>She shivered. There was too much of Rei &#8212; of Kaworu, even &#8212;
      about this mysterious woman who called herself Fox, a name with all the
      undertones of shapeshifting tricksters. And those questions she had asked on
      the threshold of Asuka's room. Had they meant to be an oblique hint that she
      was being controlled? And if so, by whom? Kitsune herself, by force of will?
      Ikari, and all he stood for, by channelling her in certain directions? By the
      memory of her father, from guilt? She did not know her own true will. But
      there was a more physical, more tangible, puzzle for her to worry at.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I'm off, back,&#8221; the lie came easy, &#8220;Call me if
      there's any development.&#8221; She patted her phone to indicate. She waited
      until she was by herself in the corridor outside before patting her gun, to
      check the reassuring presence, drawing it, checking the magazine, and then
      reholstering. As if it would do any good.</p>

    <p>Nonetheless, it was time to get to the bottom of things.</p>

    <p>&#8220;It is time.&#8221; She remembered Rei's flat statement, before
      she too had left.</p>

    <p>How much time did she, did they all, have left? How close, how short the
      countdown remaining, until Third Impact?</p>

    <p>She felt that she was on the right track when on one of the lower levels,
      as she transferred between the various elevators, when she saw one &#8212;
      the last? &#8212; of the blue and white units that had followed Kitsune,
      hovering in the middle of the corridor. It did nothing &#8212; at least that
      she could see &#8212; as she sidled past it. It didn't even turn to follow
      her.</p>

    <p>Down, down into the pit. To the secured doors labelled as the LCL
      manufacturing plant, with its ominous shoot on sight warning. Doors that now
      stood open, as if their purpose was done, that there was nothing left to gain
      from concealment.</p>

    <p>Now, habit took over. She edged over to one wall, crept forwards, three
      quarters flattened against the support, the cover.</p>

    <p>Voices ahead, speaking low, indistinct.</p>

    <p>Hardly breathing, she skulked forwards the last yards to where the tunnel
      opened out into the chamber where the sad Angel was hanging, crucified, over
      the lake of plasm that they bottled and called Link Connection Liquid.</p>

    <p>Two figures. The Commander standing, arms crossed, save when he adjusted
      his glasses. And &#8212; and who? At first, she took it to be Rei standing
      there, naked. But then she realised that Ikari was looking up as he spoke
      to the woman, not down.</p>

    <p>As Misato stood there at the threshold, the woman turned her head. It was
      not a natural movement &#8212; only the head turned, further than seemed
      possible for normal human anatomy &#8212; but the face was Rei's, was
      Kitsune's. She spoke, in lower pitch, in a tone that carried further, but in
      the same flat style as Rei.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Do not be reticent, Major Katsuragi. The conclave is not yet
      quorate, and a human perspective would be,&#8221; a slight pause,
      &#8220;informative.&#8221;</p>

    <p>She let her gun, part drawn, slide back into its holster, pulled her
      jacket straight, stood up tall, and, taking a deep breath, strode forwards.
      The Commander and the woman both watched her as she approached, without any
      perceptible change in expression.</p>

    <p>&#8220;What did you mean, a human perspective?&#8221;</p>

    <p>The woman turned, without seeming to move, just rotating about a vertical
      axis, to show a body simplified like a doll's &#8212; like an angel's
      &#8212; <span class="hint" title="cf. the Muse, Serendipity, in 'Dogma'">without definition</span>. Up
      close, there seemed to be a luminosity about the pale flesh. She looked down
      at Misato, spoke without moving those pale lips.</p>

    <p>&#8220;You are the only fully human entity who will be here. All the rest
      are something other.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Commander?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;It is true. I am fused with the embryo, the kernel, of the first
      Angel.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;But if you have Adam, then what..&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;..is that, Major?&#8221; The Commander's expression as he pointed
      up at the crucified figure could only barely be described as a smile, so
      bleak it was. &#8220;That is Lilith, the second Angel.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;<span class="hint" title="The fusion never refers to itself by a pronoun, neither 1st nor 3rd person">And
        this Ensemble</span>,&#8221; the pale woman, &#8220;that you previously
      knew as the First Child and as Kitsune, who was Nancy Elanor, Lady Wolf, also
      speaks for Lilith, who is a source of this flesh. The others will be present
      soon, now that the battle is over.&#8221;</p>

    <p>A light blossomed next to Ensemble, formed into the luminous form a woman,
      dark haired, clad in something long and white.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Yui,&#8221; the Commander spoke in recognition.</p>

    <p>&#8220;You know me as Unit 01, Major.&#8221; the woman spoke in a sweet
      voice.</p>

    <p>Could this be the soul of &#8212;? She remembered the brute carnivore
      that had devoured the heart of the 14<sup>th</sup> Angel. And that had been
      this&#8230;?</p>

    <p>Something red next to the Commander resolved into the form of Asuka
      Langley Soryu, clad in her plug-suit, hanging limply in mid air, almost like
      a kitten being carried by the scruff of its neck, her body slightly curled,
      head slumped forwards, face hidden in her long loose red hair, looking no
      more aware than she had been not so long ago, lying in that hospital bed. In
      the same remote voice that she had used from the capsule, she spoke.</p>

    <p>&#8220;<span class="hint" title="The last words from the Cross.  Very appropriate for Evangelion.">It
        is accomplished.</span>&#8221; A pause. &#8220;Dearest Misato. <span class="hint"
        title="From the first words of Phoenix to the X-Men">I am no
        longer the woman you knew.</span>&#8221; There was a hint of animation, of
      sorrow, about the voice in that second utterance.</p>

    <p>The four turned away from Misato, to the position opposite her, between
      the Commander and Ensemble. A siamese cat sat there, its fur a greyish shade
      of robin's egg blue, tending to indigo-black at the points, eyes shut,
      daintily washing one paw. It groomed itself for some moments, then put the
      paw down, wrapped its tail around its front feet, and opened eyes that were
      like sapphires.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I stand for the Seraphim.</p>

    <p>&#8220;All are now convened.&#8221; it announced, &#8220;The judgement
      can commence. State your positions.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I did all this to be with Yui.&#8221; &#8212; Gendo Ikari.</p>

    <p>&#8220;We cloned God, so that we could shout &#8216;<em>I
        am</em>&#8217; at the Universe, even after the Earth, and Moon, and Sun are
      gone. I am offered up on the altar to that end.&#8221; &#8212; Yui/Unit
      01.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Wholeness is sought.&#8221; &#8212; Ensemble.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I am unforeseen. Help me.&#8221; &#8212; Asuka.</p>

    <p>There was a pause that opened up. Misato became aware of the intensity of
      the gazes upon her.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Me??&#8221; She swallowed hard. &#8220;I wanted to know what was
      going on. I want Kaji back. I want to be back home. I only know what I
      want.&#8221; There was a feeling of bitterness in her throat, like she was
      about to be sick. &#8220;No, if I'm honest, I don't even know that. I'm a
      mess. I can't speak for anyone. Even myself.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I offer only the forlorn hope, the last spin of the wheel, another
      spin of the cylinder, before the trigger is pulled.&#8221; &#8212; the
      cat.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Neko-san, may I&#8230;?&#8221; She did not know what was going
      on, what was implied. If she was to provide any sort of human perspective,
      she had to ask, to hope that she could understand at least superficially,
      before the end.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Ask your questions,&#8221; the cat acknowledged her request,
      &#8220;though not all those here will need you to voice them.&#8221; .</p>

    <p>&#8220;For my part, I represent the Powers on the Earth that spawned the
      woman you knew as Kitsune, from the future of a different past. I can unleash
      some of their capabilities, to indiscriminately distribute the keys to
      transcendence. It would be like opening Pandora's box &#8212; and perhaps,
      just perhaps, there might be hope at the very bottom. I am here for if all
      else fails.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Asuka,&#8221; this was the most pressing question, &#8220;what
      happened to you?&#8221;</p>

    <p>The limp form &#8212; the image &#8212; spoke again &#8220;I fought, I
      won, but now I am too large to fit back into the body that once housed me. To
      win, I over-synchronized, but not just with Unit 02, which is now but another
      small part of me. My original shell did not dissolve, but the 'I' that thinks
      is now spread across Kitsune's entire tactical net, all the monitors she
      assigned to me. This was not meant to happen. I cannot sustain &#8212; this
      nexus of flesh needs nourishment that cannot be supplied where it is, is not
      subsumed.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Indeed. Your use of the monitors was not something anticipated. As
      weapons they were discounted. Synchronization is the factor that was
      overlooked.&#8221; Ensemble. &#8220;Your immediate problem is but
      engineering. Modalities that you lack in your current configuration can be
      supplied. This does not cause an obvious conflict regarding outcome.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Or subsumption can be chosen, rather than exile.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Then the pale woman turned her white eyes, eyes that seemed to burn with
      inner lambency, towards Misato.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Some of the things that one wants to know, to find out, can only
      be appreciated by experiencing them. So it was with Kitsune. Such was the
      potential in the Ayanami series. Each of those different entities were also
      constructed with a higher goal in mind. This is the offer for each to step
      beyond the merely human &#8212; if you have trust in the guide. Unlike the
      unguided option that the Seraphim hold in reserve.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Kitsune &#8212; you warned <em>me</em> not to precipitate
      matters,&#8221; Gendo Ikari broke in, &#8220;Yet you did this.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;And if you had been warned not to breathe, or your heart not to
      beat? That was the strength of the imperative that faced those two. And
      things are not yet irreversible, as the very fact of this meeting makes
      abundantly clear.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Commander &#8212; what was the Instrumentality Program &#8212;
      what were you &#8212; trying to achieve?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;After the destruction of the other Angels, to use those that
      remained here under our control to attain the alchymic marriage of Adam and
      Lilith. For me, the reunion with Yui. For the rest of the world, what it
      willed. But Rei was to have been the key.&#8221; He looked sourly at
      Ensemble. &#8220;And she has taken her own path. Now, after Akagi did what
      she did, there is no replacement available.&#8221;</p>

    <p>One participant remained.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Who are you really? And what do you want?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I am the shade &#8212; perhaps the image &#8212; of she who was
      Yui Ikari. For a long time, I have slumbered, dreamed deep dreams. I dreamed
      I carried my son once again. Now, wakefulness has come upon me &#8212; I
      have been drawn out of reverie by this other image of that earlier self. My
      wants are simple &#8212; to sleep, to dream the Universe as the aeons pass,
      but I fear I shall simply be crucified throughout the ages, the last witness
      to the follies of Man.&#8221;</p>

    <p>There was a pause, a silence, save for the steady dripping of the plasm
      from the body of Lilith.</p>

    <p>&#8220;The resolution is obvious,&#8221; the cat stated, imperiously. It
      stood, arched its back, then extended each hind leg in turn, stretching out
      in a luxuriating fashion. And with no other word, turned its back, and, tail
      high, strode into strange distance, vanished. After a barely perceptible
      moment, the images of Yui Ikari and Asuka Soryu vanished.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221; Misato could not restrain the reaction. Something had
      happened that had gone past her. If she had provided a human perspective,
      what had she done? What had these others decided?</p>

    <p>Ensemble spoke again, reading, she was sure, this turmoil.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Do you still have trust, Major Katsuragi?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;You should be able to tell, shouldn't you? That I know that you're
      as fallible and as fucked up as the rest of us, that you can be sure. But
      then, that's nothing new. That's all we've ever had.&#8221; She looked up
      into that calm white face. &#8220;This is it, isn't it, you're going to do
      it. Third Impact. End of the world.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;No, not with a bang, but a sigh. Soon. <span class="hint"
        title="Allusion to the last chapter of 'The Last Battle' by CS Lewis">Soon
        the holidays will begin, for everyone.</span> After work is done. There is
      one task remaining before the curtain can come down. A final parting of ways
      that you must mediate, to bid farewell.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Ikari,&#8221; and the penetrating gaze turned away, &#8220;your
      fate is necessary and not to be envied. But you are acquiescent.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;In its way, it is what I sought, and many would say that it is
      more than I deserve.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Five billion years is but the blinking of an eye. Kitsune
      witnessed some of the nearer abyss, billion-fold later, after the stars have
      gone out, and the galaxies sundered. If there are other witnesses, they will
      gather by the deeps. Ascension is held now in abeyance for your
      journey.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Like the cat, Ensemble turned her back, and walked away, towards Lilith,
      walking on the surface of that yellow lake.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Major Katsuragi,&#8221; the Commander spoke, &#8220;As the only
      uncommitted agent here, I ask you, please escort me to Unit 01. It will be
      necessary to convince Dr. Akagi that I should be allowed to pilot our
      remaining Evangelion.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Me?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;You are the only one left to do it. And perhaps what friendship
      the two of you once had can persuade her to permit this, despite Kitsune's
      instructions to the contrary.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Can't she &#8212; what's left of her &#8212; do that?&#8221;
      looking out at the figure standing at the foot of the cross, dwarfed by the
      monstrous form of the Angel.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Can &#8212; certainly. Will &#8212; certainly not. She has
      delegated that task And at this point I know I no longer have meaningful
      authority over you, so cannot order it done. But I can say that if Adam or
      Eva remain here, then their presence will be disruptive. It may not be the
      Third Impact as you imagine, as a replay of the Second, but the negative
      effects on those that remain will be no less.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I do not know how long we have. But I suggest that we make
      haste.&#8221;</p>
    <hr />

    <p>&#8220;&#8230;and stay down.&#8221;</p>

    <p>The trance-like voice was the only useful data that Maya &#8212; that
      anyone in the main control room &#8212; had coming in from the outside
      world. They had long ago switched off the static-laced camera feeds.</p>

    <p>There was a long pause.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Pilot Soryu wishes to report that they were wusses after all.
      Misato? Kitsune?&#8221;</p>

    <p>Another pause. Just enough for sighs of relief and spontaneous applause to
      break out, not long enough to recover, realise that it was safe to speak, and
      to do so.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Kitsune? Oh, like&#8230;&#8221;</p>

    <p>And the voice faded, though the rest of the Unit 02 telemetry carried on
      in its monotonous fashion.</p>

    <p>&#8220;External sensors coming back on line.&#8221; Shigeru. &#8220;We
      only have one AT field in view, and it has Unit 02's signature.&#8221;</p>

    <p>The main screen lit up, showing the default tactical display with the
      terrain above the geofront, dominated by the crater that had been Tokyo-3,
      with the Eva's location marked. And, as live data were painted on, a massive
      spike, bigger than any of the Angels, in the same place.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Integrating surviving external cameras and <span class="hint"
        title="Optical synthetic aperture satellite system from Quicksilver by Reeves-Stevens">MAJIC</span>
      feed. Imaging coming up&#8230;&#8221;</p>

    <p>Everyone reacted with surprise as the screen was repainted with the
      synthesised image. The scene around where Unit 02 had emerged, in what had
      been wooded land beyond the outskirts of the city, was one of devastation,
      almost every tree smashed, the lake surface covered in floating debris.
      Already crows were settling on the scattered shards of synthetic flesh and
      armour that had been the Eva series. And in the midst of it all stood Asuka,
      a mile high, standing at rest, hands clasped in front of her at her waist,
      head held up to look at the sky, clad in the scarlet and black of her
      plug-suit, her flame coloured hair pouring down her back. <span class="hint"
        title="Where else to park the nine blades/Longinus Lances?">On her brow, a
        twisted wreath of crimson thorns</span>.</p>

    <div class="hide" style="float:right;">
      <div style="padding:5px;border: black 1px solid;text-align: center;background-color: #eee;color:inherit">
        <img height="512" width="430" src="bing240221-113021_9778.jpg" alt="Asuka and the crown of thorns" />
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>&#8220;Asuka!&#8221; As stand in for Ritsuko, it was Maya's role to
      monitor the Eva pilots &#8212; pilot. Now the battle appeared over, they
      surely had to try and recover the Eva and its pilot &#8212; but what was
      that manifestation, what did it mean? All the life support system signals
      seemed to suggest that Asuka was &#8212; had been &#8212; in a comatose
      state. Only that almost unheard of 220% synch ratio that was still holding
      spoke otherwise. &#8220;Asuka!&#8221; she called again.</p>

    <p>After a pause which suggested that there would be no response, the slow
      voice again. &#8220;We are in conference. Please wait.&#8221;</p>

    <p>While Maya fretted with the limited controls she had available, trying to
      find out what had happened, whether this was going to require another salvage
      operation or quite what, the Sub-Commander was calling for other situation
      reports, and finally giving the command they had all been hoping for.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Stand down to regular watch.&#8221; and then continued,
      &#8220;and, Lt. Ibuki, now perhaps you could tell me what has happened to
      our pilot.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Insufficient data, sir. I don't know what was done to even wake
      her up, let alone enable her to synchronize like this. Her life signs are
      stable, and she appears to be in no immediate danger. Unit 02's life support
      capacity is currently open-ended, so there is no urgency in recovering her.
      And for the moment, she seems to be concentrating on something else other
      than us, so would most likely not cooperate.&#8221;</p>

    <p>From the corner of her eye, she spotted a light winking on her board.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Sir? May I? It's Dr. Akagi.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Very well, go ahead.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Maya picked up the phone.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Maya, &#8221; Ritsuko's voice sounded agitated, &#8220;what's
      going on up there?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Uh, I think we've won. The Eva series have been destroyed. And
      Asuka's &#8212; well, probably OK, but you'd have to see for
      yourself.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I think you had better come down here, then. Something is
      happening to Unit 01 &#8212; it appears to be waking up. I need you to help
      put it back into cryostasis.&#8221;</p>

    <p>She relayed the message to Sub-Commander Fuyutsuki, who nodded
      dismissively, and picked up the red phone. Taking that as assent, Maya
      replied &#8220;I'm on my way.&#8221;</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Even jogging, even taking the moving ways, there was a respectable amount
      of ground to cover between the main mission control and the cage where Unit
      01 was parked, the scale of the geofront being what it was. So it was with a
      little impatience that Maya answered her phone on the move when she saw it
      was Ritsuko calling.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Still <em xml:lang="fr">en route</em>,&#8221; she reported,
      trying not to fumble the handset.</p>

    <p>&#8220;We may be in big trouble,&#8221; Ritsuko announced,
      &#8220;Something has crawled out of one of Kitsune's devices and is starting
      to make changes to Unit 01.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;OK. There soon,&#8221; she gasped, and started running. But along
      with the automatic impulse to assist Ritsuko she found herself wondering what
      she was about to let herself in for. She didn't think that this would be as
      simple as guessing red wire or blue. But then there was a feeling that this
      wasn't going to be something she could run away from.</p>

    <p>She pounded down the last length of corridor, fumbled her card twice
      trying to swipe it through the reader, then with a deliberate effort to
      breathe slowly and deeply, despite the impulse to pant for air, she strode
      carefully in to the operations room overlooking Unit 01. She could see
      Ritsuko on the catwalk running in front of the Eva at its shoulder height,
      pacing nervously, looking up into its huge glowing eyes, and down at the
      metal spider that seemed to be weaving silver wire egg casings around the
      torso of the Eva. As she watched, one of the blue and white cylinders that
      Kitsune had brought drifted into reach of the spider, which caught it, and
      started to spin it into the growing mass.</p>

    <p>She took up the PA, and called down to Ritsuko, telling her that she was
      about to start cryostasis, then sat herself down at one of the technicians'
      workstations and fired it up. She was in the process of getting the
      configuration set up as she preferred it, when the door opened behind her.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Excellent.&#8221;</p>

    <p>She recognised the Commander's voice before she could even begin to turn
      around.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Sir,&#8221; the reflex salutation came out neutrally, as she spun
      her seat around, stood up, seeing that Misato was there too.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Commence launch readiness procedures for Unit 01,
      Lieutenant.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;But, Sir&#8230;&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Maya, &#8221; Misato spoke, &#8220;We have to launch Unit 01.
      It's that or &#8212; something as bad as Third Impact, as far as I can
      tell.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Is Shinji there? Where?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I shall be piloting Unit 01.&#8221; Ikari looked down at her,
      adjusted his glasses, then peered out into the hangar beyond, &#8220;Where
      is Dr. Akagi?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;She was out there on the transverse walkway.&#8221; But there was
      no sign but an abandoned clipboard.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Major Katsuragi, if you would take the door?&#8221;</p>

    <p>Maya was shocked to see Misato draw her gun, take a comfortable two-handed
      grasp of it, and aim at the door, keeping her body between the door and the
      Commander. Surprised, as there had been enough odd little incidents &#8212;
      unexpected accesses to sensitive data from TacOps workstations &#8212;
      recently to suggest that Misato had turned against whatever hidden agenda the
      Commander was following.</p>

    <p>The door opened, and Ritsuko started in, pistol first. Her eyes caught
      Maya's briefly, then she stopped, startled, on seeing Misato there too.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Put it away, Ritsuko.&#8221; Misato sounded weary but firm.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I,&#8221; Ritsuko started, hesitated, &#8220;Why are
      <em>you</em> defending him?&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;I understand you want to kill me, Dr. Akagi, and I understand why
      you do. If you let Major Katsuragi explain, then perhaps you will understand
      why you would be doing me a favour by doing so. But no-one else.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Ritsuko was looking startled. Maya was sure that she wasn't doing much
      better at retaining her composure.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Commander Ikari is going to be aboard Unit 01 when we launch, and
      it is going to be sent out into space. It's going to be a one-way
      trip.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Project-E! You're going back to the first secret goal of Project-E
      &#8212; only&#8230;&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Yes. Only that did not include a pilot as part of the Witness
      program. But now it is imperative that I &#8212; or rather that Adam within
      me &#8212; is removed from the earthly sphere, and Eva &#8212; as now
      enhanced &#8212; is the only means we have to achieve that.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Ritsuko stood a moment in thought.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Damn you, Gendo. You win again. May it bring you everything you
      deserve.&#8221; She reversed her gun, held it out to Misato. &#8220;Take
      this. I need to get things ready. Plug-suit?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;That will not be needed. I have Kitsune's last gift.&#8221; He
      held out a block of silvery metal set with a blue gem, then turned his back
      and casually, efficiently, began to undress. Maya could not help noticing
      terrible scars on his back, running around his torso, before a wave of
      whiteness covered him. The Commander turned to face them again, dressed in a
      white plug-suit, with dark blue flashings &#8212; it looked almost like
      Rei's suit &#8212; not, as she had vaguely expected in the circumstances,
      the blue of Unit 01's pilot's, of Shinji Ikari's, suit. But what she first
      took to be the 00 designation was not &#8212; rather it was an infinity
      symbol &#8212; &infin;</p>

    <p>&#8220;So that&#8230;?&#8221; Misato half asked a question.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Yes, Major, it is the thing I picked up from the elevator. Now, if
      you will excuse me, I need to embark.&#8221;</p>

    <p>And without further ceremony, he departed.</p>

    <p>Through the window, Maya watched him emerge from the pilot pre-flight
      area, and seat himself in the control unit, ready to be lifted into the entry
      plug. She couldn't tell from the distance whether his expression was that of
      a man going to face a firing squad, or one who had been reprieved from one,
      though she followed him until the hatch slid shut. And then it was all
      routine, despite the great silver fairings strapped around Eva Unit 01, like
      the wing cases of titanic beetles.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Misato watched the launch preparations as she always had, expecting the
      technical people to do their work at least as efficiently as she carried out
      hers. As the preparations advanced, as the entry plug carrying Commander
      Ikari was fitted into place, she wondered whether she ought not be contacting
      someone to inform them what was going on. But who? Not that there was
      anything anyone could do about the launch &#8212; and the main control room
      team would find out about it soon enough. Not that there was anything anyone
      could do about pretty much anything, even if she told them all.</p>

    <p>Twice, she picked up the phone to contact whoever might be in charge,
      hesitated, and put it down again.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Launch when ready!&#8221; she ordered.</p>

    <p>The various supports and restraints fell away, and the Evangelion began to
      move along the launch system rails, accelerating rapidly, quickly gone from
      sight as it began its final ascent.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Final restraints disengaged,&#8221; Maya reported a few seconds
      later, &#8220;<em xml:lang="fr">Bon voyage</em>, Commander.&#8221;</p>

    <p>She paused, reading the telemetry.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Pilot synch ratio approaching 100%. Environmental telemetry shows
      that the unit is under an acceleration of just under 2g, going straight up.
      I'm not sure how long we'll have signal &#8212; the system's not designed
      for long range operation like this.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I don't think it matters,&#8221; Misato said, &#8220;It's done,
      it's out of our hands now.&#8221;</p>

    <p>She felt ridiculously old, and tired, yet at the same time strangely
      elated, liberated, all her previous cares now meaningless, trivial.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I don't know how much longer we have. If there's anything you have
      to say to anybody, before it's too late, anyone you have to call, now's the
      time.</p>

    <p>&#8220;It's been a privilege to have worked with both of you. Ritsuko
      &#8212; I'm sorry things went sour between us recently. I remember the good
      times, I hope you do too. Maya, thank you for all your efforts against the
      Angels.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Now, I have one last thing to do. Goodbye.&#8221;</p>

    <p>And she turned and left, still wondering what had caused <span class="hint"
        title="'End of' seems to hint that Maya carries a torch for Ritsuko.  Here, she does.">the
        sudden shocked &#8212; almost guilty &#8212; expression on Maya's
        face</span> when she had as much as told them to say their final farewells.
      For her part &#8212; well, apart from Ritsuko, who was there that she was
      close enough to to want to spend what little time there was left with? So
      many of her relationships were just purely professional, mutual respect,
      rather than friendship or anything more intimate. And there was a limit to
      how much she could do by herself to set the world to rights, to tidy up loose
      ends. Who were there that she needed to speak to before the end? Kaji was
      dead, Asuka was changed, Pen-Pen was far away, and couldn't understand
      &#8212; but there was one person remaining that she needed to try and settle
      matters with, even if it meant wasting her last breath.</p>

    <p>Shinji.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>She found him near where she recalled the last trace had been.</p>

    <p>At any moment as she made the ascent, she had expected something, she knew
      not what, to call everything to a close. Around her, life seemed to go on
      almost as normal, strangely calm. At a couple of points, she had had to step
      aside as squads of NERV security went by, escorting prisoners who had been
      stripped to their underwear. Special Forces, she guessed. While exchanging
      reflex salutes, old habits had snapped in, &#8220;Don't forget &#8212;
      cavity searches before you leave the prisoners unattended,
      Sergeant!&#8221;</p>

    <p>But now, the last corridor, a couple of Kitsune's monitors floating
      seemingly aimlessly, and then, under a set of mesh stairs, in a half
      kneeling, half sprawled pose, the Third Child. Even for a gangly teenager,
      not sure how long his limbs were today, the pose had a singular lack of
      grace, more like a puppet, strings cut, tossed away into a corner to gather
      dust. He was clutching his Walkman to himself like a Bible. His eyes were
      open, in a thousand yard stare.</p>

    <p>She squatted down beside him, took the little foam plug out of one of his
      ears. She expected to hear the faint tinny sounds of the tape he always
      played &#8212; but there was only silence.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Shinji, pet,&#8221; she began. Without turning his head, without
      showing any other reaction, he took the wire from her hand, put the earpiece
      back again.</p>

    <p>The second time, she was ready for that reaction, caught the wrist,
      expecting a struggle, but on encountering resistance, he just gave up. Misato
      let the arm drop limply. This was his normal &#8212; well, it wasn't even
      active enough to be called dumb insolence &#8212; the way he just said
      &#8220;yes&#8221; to everything. She wondered if she might not have better
      spent the last remaining time once again trying to convince young Suzuhara to
      see &#8212; be seen by &#8212; his little sister, before the end. At least
      there she would expect to have met resistance, argument. Here, it was like
      speaking to a post.</p>

    <p>But now she had his ear &#8212; what could she say to him? That he would
      never pilot an Eva again &#8212; never have to. That his father had run away
      with his mother, had taken his Eva away from him for good. That Asuka had
      piloted her Eva, fought and won the last vital battle. Any of that, any talk
      of the present, would beat him down further, maybe destroy him. Should she
      just hold him? Most boys of his age would find being cuddled, the close
      physical contact, by an older woman secretly exciting &#8212; but on other
      occasions, Shinji had recoiled from her touch. She'd seen the surveillance
      tapes, the security debriefs, of him and Kaworu &#8212; was half the problem
      &#8212; beyond that of being fourteen &#8212; that he'd realised &#8212;
      feared, even &#8212; that he was gay?</p>

    <p>&#8220;Oh, Shinji, my boy &#8212; what are we going to do with
      you?&#8221;</p>

    <p>When she had been his age &#8212; that had been when the Second Impact,
      whatever the truth behind that, had happened. And she had spent years not
      talking, in not much better state that this, until the shock and horrors that
      she had experienced had played themselves in her head so many times that it
      eventually became boring, the damage callused over by thick layers of mere
      familiarity, and she could pick up the fragments of her life, and start
      again. Should she tell him that time would heal all these wounds, that
      eventually you got to a state where you could at least give the outward show
      that marked an adult, however you felt inside &#8212; that his father had
      managed that sort of public fa&ccedil;ade, that he could at least achieve that much.
      But there wouldn't <em>be</em> time.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Oh, Kitsune, how long?&#8221;</p>

    <p>But if not for her intervention, then &#8212; the horrified realisation
      struck her that she would almost certainly have had to come here, and try to
      drag this at least partly functional pilot to an Eva, probably through a
      fire-fight. And here she was, holding him, cradling his head against her
      breasts, and waiting, waiting, for something. What a sorry state to be in at
      the end of the world, clinging to an under-age kid, as the only warm body
      around, for all that he was no more active than a teddy bear, than a doll. A
      bleak fragment of a smile played on her lips &#8212; both the girls had
      rebelled in their own way against dolls, being dolls. The Third Child seemed
      to want to become one.</p>

    <p>Then there was something &#8212; a change in the quality of the light? A
      sound or cessation of sound? Then a whiteness, like morning sunlight through
      heavily frosted glass, approaching down the corridor. Silhouetted against the
      light, then illumined by it, Rei in the green school dress and white blouse
      that she had seen discarded in the elevator from Terminal Dogma, holding out
      her hand, a strange expression of concern on her face, the same as there had
      been on Yui Ikari's image.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I am your guide. Come, it is beginning.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;But what about&#8230;&#8221; But Shinji was no longer there.
      Everything was lost in the light.</p>

    <p>She reached out to the proffered hand. There was so much light.</p>

    <p>Misato Katsuragi closed her eyes for the last time.</p>

    <h2>Author's note (2004)</h2>

    <p>Having scorned TV since the late 80s, and thus <em xml:lang="la">a
        fortiori</em> never had a video player, it wasn't until <cite>Neon Genesis
        Evangelion</cite> came out on computer readable media &#8212; to wit, region
      2 DVD &#8212; during late 2003 that I finally caught up with what many
      people have known about for the best part of a decade. Then, having watched
      the 26 episodes, by this March ('04) I ventured on to <cite>the End of
        Evangelion</cite>. That was definitely not the &#8220;what if it were a
      normal high-school mecha-pilot anime?&#8221; of the fragment in episode 26.
      It certainly had a strong impact on me. There were two reactions &#8212;
      that Shinji was even more of a jerk than is an unavoidable occupational
      hazard of being a 14-year&#8211;old boy, and that Asuka got a really raw
      deal in the end.</p>

    <p>This was something I wanted to work out of my system &#8212; that
      started out as an idle day-dream &#8212; how would Nancy Wolf, equipped as
      in <a href="index.html"><cite>Castles in the Sky</cite></a>, sort things out
      to save Asuka from being stuck alone with Shinji for all eternity, assuming
      that the unmodified trajectory of events would be episodes 1&#8211;24 then
      <cite>End of</cite>. Surely she was outrageously powerful enough, had enough
      overkill, that she could arrange a happy ending for Asuka?
    </p>

    <p>But then, this is <cite>Evangelion</cite> we're talking about &#8212;
      it doesn't <em>do</em> happy endings &#8212; ambiguous ones maybe, but
      not happy. As I started to work through how as one person with finite,
      albeit large, resources, Nancy could act to change the outcome, things
      became less and less magic wand quick fix, with more constraints, more
      obstacles, more possibilities for narrative tension. And at that point
      I thought it became worth actually writing it out properly.</p>

    <p>Then events and characters took over &#8212; Asuka's use of the monitors
      was something I, as author, hadn't anticipated until I started detailing the
      scene where Nancy was only able to watch the battle against the Eva series
      from afar, a startling revelation to me as I cycled home. Nor had I
      anticipated &#8220;killing off&#8221; Nancy herself within that same scene,
      barely after the half-way stage of the narrative. I was surprised at the degree
      of unforced similarity between two independently invented characters such
      as Nancy (c.1975, UK) and Rei (c.1995, Japan), and played it up only slightly
      &#8212; by giving Nancy Rei's soft-spoken voice.</p>

    <p>This has also given me a chance to get out of my system some of the
      back-story from <cite>Castles in the Sky</cite> that I needed to have worked
      out, but none of the viewpoint characters had anything to do with &#8212;
      arrival, preliminary scouting, other process, as well as the enjoyable
      opportunity to revisit the characters of <cite>Evangelion</cite>, say how I
      finally came to see them, and carry them and the newcomer(s) forwards, each,
      where possible, with their own distinct use of language in style and
      vocabulary. And the chance of trying my hand at the difficult task of
      carrying the narrative up to the point of the transition to the
      transhuman.</p>

    <p>In a number of places, dialogue echoes or directly quotes from other
      sources, where this may enhance the reader's appreciation of sub-texts the
      annotation will show tool-tips (and in Mozilla, including Firefox, and other
      CSS compliant browsers &#8212; alas not IE, yet &#8212; these areas will
      show by fading slightly) when the mouse moves over them. Some is of course,
      given the nature of the source material, scriptural in origin, but there are
      other, more recent sources, taken as appropriate. The last sentence of the
      tale is also in this style, as an example.</p>

    <p>The rendition of Nancy's first language is as Ceqli, an actual modern-day
      synthetic language, details of which can be found at
      <a
        href="http://web.archive.org/web/20021009171818/http://www.geocities.com/ceqli/Uploadexp.htm">http://web.archive.org/web/20021009171818/http://www.geocities.com/ceqli/Uploadexp.htm</a>.
      There is a tool-tip for translation in the hint style. In order to achieve
      the Ceqli phrase that I wanted, <a href="empyrean.html">unlike in previous uses</a>,
      I needed to get a new word <cite xml:lang="x-ceqli" title="save, rescue (Irish)">
        taral</cite> added to its lexicon by its inventor. (Thanks, Rex!)
    </p>

    <p>And when she speaks that phrase, if it were an anime, that would be when
      the background music would cue <cite><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhDFL2kxl0M">Salva Nos</a></cite> by
      Yuki Kajiura.</p>

    <p>Some of the nomenclature &#8212; Friendly, with a capital F, &#8220;hard
      take-off&#8221; and such &#8212; regarding the Singularity are taken from
      the terminology of the (Future) Shock Level 4 mailing list from
      <a href="http://www.sl4.org">sl4.org</a> and related Singularitarian haunts.
