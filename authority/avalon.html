    <h1>Evening</h1>

    <p>&#8220;For Queen and country! Gloriana, Albion and St. Edmund!&#8221;</p>

    <p>The Red Cross Knight raised his sword to the skies, and called out his
      battle-cry. At the other side of the skiff, facing him across the central
      space where the simple square-rigged mast was stepped, Celia sat, and
      considered.</p>

    <p>The knight had knelt before her in the abbey courtyard, that self-same
      blade that now reflected the late sunshine almost blinding in the forenoon
      radiance as he held it out on his mail-gloved palms. It was clearly a working
      weapon, the edge, though ground sharp, was slightly ragged, like some of the
      full-metal re-enactors' swords she had seen at gaming conventions, nicked and
      notched by clashes with armour. Unlike the facsimiles, the almost just for
      show blades ground like carving knives from a simple slab of steel, under its
      lacework of engraving, and in the deep blood-gutters, on this one she could
      see the swirling twists of light and darker phases of steel of a proper
      composite construction.</p>

    <p>Nonplussed for a moment, she knew something would be expected of her.
      Slipping her bracelet down to her knuckles, she unclasped it enough to pass
      over her thumb. Holding it secure around her palm, she passed her hand
      palm-down along the length of the blade, as if to magnetise it with the
      bracelet's magic.</p>

    <p>That was clearly the sort of thing that had been looked for, as the
      Knight's reverent expression showed. And though the sunlight made it hard to
      tell, had there been some glimmer of another glow that briefly limned the
      sword's edge? She took it in her stride. Always stay calm when the punters
      expect you to know what you're doing, even when it's a big bluff. It had
      worked as a rule of thumb for her security work, whenever she was having to
      proceed by intuition.</p>

    <p>Now she just had to figure out what exactly it was she had achieved. Not
      whatever magic it was she might or might not have done, but what it had done
      to how she was perceived.</p>

    <p>The knight stood, sheathed the sword with a rasping of metal on metal, as
      the nuns took hesitant steps back. Joining in the mass shuffling, Celia
      noted, from the corner of her eye. that the Abbess was looking at her
      somewhat askance, but this was not a suitable time for questions.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I thank your ladyship. And now we must ride. The Queen awaits!&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Sir Knight, I must protest!&#8221; The Abbess was trying to regain control of
      the situation. &#8220;The Lady of the Mark is lodged as our guest by one of the
      Sisters of the Moon. We may not simply surrender her.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Then I shall answer to the Sisters as they please, for else I shall
      certainly answer to the Queen.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Celia's mind raced. Who to side with? The fact that Aradia could find her
      at home, back in the mundane world left her little doubt that she could be
      found again, and if the Queen were at London, or even somewhere else
      appropriate like Winchester, they'd still be heading in the right
      direction.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I am bound for Kaer Ludd, so if the Queen is at the Tower, or Hampton, or
      parts between, then the paths run together. I must gather my belongings, and
      then we may depart.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;She holds her court in the White Tower at this season. That will be on
      the path you take.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Ah, that Tower, she thought. And more horse-riding, she added ruefully, as
      she turned to the Abbess.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Well, that was soon sorted. Now could you assign me a guide so that I can
      get back to the cell where I left everything.&#8221;</p>

    <p>The Abbess pursed her lips, paused, then &#8220;Follow me.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Sir Knight, you will wait here for our return. The rest of you, back
      about your duties.&#8221; before striding briskly back into the cloisters, Celia
      following close behind.</p>

    <p>Once inside, and out of sight from the courtyard, the Abbess had turned to
      her.</p>

    <p>&#8220;You <em>knew</em> what to do. &#8221; she accused.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Huh? Oh, you mean with the sword. No, I didn't know. It just felt an
      appropriate thing to do. A lucky guess.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Less luck than you think. Remember, the Lady's magic springs from the
      heart, not long and complicated invocations and formulae. The Gift may be
      with you when it is needed. Just trust in her and it will be provided.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Celia hoped that her cynicism didn't show in her expression at this &#8220;Trust
      to the Force&#8221; style admonition, the sort of thing that negated thought,
      though she realised that she had known that from years before. As it
      happened, the Abbess at that point stepped into a little alcove that was the
      bottom of a steep and narrow spiral stair, to ascend to the dormitory
      corridor.</p>

    <p>A couple of twists and turns from the top, they came to the cell where her
      rucksack and discarded set of normal clothing still sat on the pallet. She
      quickly checked through, to make sure all she expected to find was there,
      then to organise things so she could add the clothes to the bundle. Some
      could be found niches, like adding knickers to the protective packing in the
      plastic lunchbox that held various bits of her electronic gadgetry wondering
      as she did so what she would find if she were to try a GPS sounding here.</p>

    <p>It was immediately clear that it wouldn't all fit, with an extra change of
      outerwear to add to an almost full load. A little squeezing and folding found
      some space, but it was soon obvious that the easiest way to carry the excess
      was going to be to wear it, admonitions about colour schemes for her outfit
      notwithstanding. So while the Abbess waited, she kicked off the sandals she
      had been fitted with, and pulled on her jeans, wearing them under the skirts
      of the monastic habit, then one of the pairs of comfortable socks that had
      been jammed in to fill one side pocket nigh to bursting, and her hiking
      boots. The process of lacing them gave her a feeling that in some measure
      again she was taking control of her life. At the same time there was a pang
      of regret &#8212; she would really like access to her own wardrobe, to pull out the
      rarely worn power-dressing suit, dressing to get herself into the take charge
      mindset, if not to impress the locals. As it was, she had only these few bits
      of severely practical outfit, and they would have to suffice.</p>

    <p>She shrugged to herself, stood, and wriggled into the rucksack. &#8220;We go.&#8221;
      she declared.</p>

    <p>Returning to the courtyard, she did feel a little more self-confidence.
      Sure. there were risks, though if her escort was whom she guessed him to be,
      her virtue should be safe enough. She shivered slightly at the thought of how
      the innocence of youth had kept her from worrying about that sort of menace
      from the black-elf and goblin hordes.</p>

    <p>Before her mood could falter, she strode out into the sunlight, and
      marched up to the knight.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I'm ready,&#8221; she declared.</p>

    <p>&#8220;You must ride with me, then, for we have much ground to cover, to be with
      the Queen this night.&#8221; He whistled, and his horse trotted over, massive, like
      the cart-horses she remembered from childhood, but as much larger in
      proportion as she too had grown, almost like a rhino, hooves leaving enormous
      prints in the dust.</p>

    <p>The knight put his left hand upon the saddle, and vaulted easily into
      place. Settled there, he started to reach out one hand, then &#8220;Go you over to
      the block yonder, and there I'll fetch you up.&#8221; She marched across to the
      mounting block near the gatehouse, the horse, for all its size, stepping
      elegantly alongside as if at an equestrian event, the Abbess and other nuns
      who had been present in the courtyard trailing after.</p>

    <p>The knight held out his hand as Celia stepped up on to the block, and she
      started to climb up onto the horse's back, but they were clearly getting in a
      tangle &#8212; he was trying to lift her up in front, while she was trying to ride
      pillion.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Ride at the front, my Lady, so I may hold you. so you shall not slip as
      we gallop.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;And have my pack hit you under the chin at every stride? I don't think
      that will work. Better if I just hang on to you.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I would rather keep hold, lest you slip off the side, and I drag you
      along before I wot of it.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I didn't tumble off the crupper even on the Lady Aradia's&#8230;&#8221; she had
      been about to say &#8220;turbocharged steed&#8221; and stopped to cast around for some
      less anachronistic phrase, when realisation dawned.</p>

    <p>&#8220;No, I shan't be riding side-saddle. Look!&#8221; she hoisted the skirts of her
      habit, and kicking out one leg to show off the jeans underneath &#8220;Canvas
      breeches!&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Very well, then, Lady,&#8221; in a tone that suggested that the honorific was
      being re-evaluated, &#8220;mount, and hold on tight.&#8221; And this time, with his
      patient assistance, she did manage to scramble up, with a little more grace
      than on the previous evening.</p>

    <p>The Knight then turned to the Abbess. &#8220;My thanks to you, Mother. Tell the
      Lady Aradia that we ride to court, if she comes seeking us here.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;So shall I, Sir Knight. But before you ride, here are provisions, as we
      were not able to offer any other hospitality.&#8221; And one of the nuns held up a
      small sack, which the knight reached down to take. As he tied it to the
      saddle, Celia caught a scent of fresh baked bread. Simple fare, then.</p>

    <p>And, with a brief instruction to his squire, the Knight took up the reins,
      and then they were off, trotting out of the abbey courtyard, and onto the old
      road, turning to head generally southward, and picking up to a respectable,
      ground-covering canter. A stone bridge of three short arches crossed the
      river, and then the road entered the wild wood.</p>

    <div class="hide" style="float:right;">
      <div style="padding:5px;border: black 1px solid;text-align: center;background-color: #eee;color:inherit">
        <img height="512" width="512" src="bing240219-211200_5542.jpg" alt="Celia and the Red Cross Knight" />
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>Now the road showed signs of age, pot-holes, patches, drifts of sandy silt
      and leaf litter, moss and weeds between the slabs. But there were also signs
      of recent work &#8212; stumps of recently felled trees, and signs of overhanging
      branches lopped, the wood still yellow with carotenes, rather than a
      weathered grey &#8212; that had cleared the route on either side, left it open to
      the full benefit of the sunlight.</p>

    <p>Though in part she was hanging on for grim death, Celia relished this
      journey, to be in motion again, and, better still, out in bright spring
      sunshine, away from the gloom of impending winter, here where flowers bloomed
      anew, and leaves were bursting from the bud.</p>

    <p>As they rode, through this primeval forest, alive with sun and birdsong,
      there were occasional glimpses of deer, stags in full antler, whose first
      appearance had caused her to start with memories of the Hunter, but which
      turned out entirely mundane. As the land rolled gently, she was afforded
      broader views out across the countryside, mostly tree-tops blurring with new
      green, but occasionally church towers, bright in the sun against dark cloud
      building up, in maddeningly brief flashes, too short to make out what sort of
      buildings surrounded them; and at times, the sound of the birds, and the
      wind, and the hoofbeats seemed to be joined by the whining hum of traffic,
      always somewhere over the next rise in the terrain, or behind a thick screen
      of trees.</p>

    <p>And after an hour or more, now sometime after noon, with cloud having
      bubbled up, first cauliflower cumulus, in rows of fair-weather cloud, then
      thicker and darker, the threat of April showers now evident, they had burst
      out of the woodland into open fields, long stripes of land, part meadow, with
      spring flowers and sheep, others with new green growth springing up. Beyond
      the fields, a village by a narrow river, a church some way outside the
      habitation.</p>

    <p>At the river, the Knight reined in and hailed one of the villagers, who
      bobbed his head in acknowledgment.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I will have a boat,&#8221; he demanded, &#8220;We must be with the Queen this
      night.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Come, Sir, Lady,&#8221; the peasant led them along the riverbank to a rude
      wharf, at which something barely more than a sailing dinghy was moored. A
      toothless old man scrambled out of a nearby shack, and grovelled, as they
      approached.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Good man,&#8221; the Knight called down, &#8220;we will have passage to the City this
      day. And thou, cotter, provide for my mount until my squire is come for
      him.&#8221;</p>

    <p>With a bound, he dismounted, and offered his hand for Celia to descend.
      Carefully, feeling sore and stiff, she managed to bring her leg up, and over
      the saddle, sliding down to land with a little splashing of mud. She had then
      stood there, feeling slightly useless, as he efficiently unpacked his
      weapons, and the sack of food. The cotter scampered up to take the sweating
      beast's reins as soon as unloading was complete, and then gingerly led the
      horse away. The Knight gave him not a glance as he strolled over to the boat,
      and laid his burden down.</p>

    <p>The boatman joined him and both held out their hands. Time to board.
      Carefully she stepped into the boat, which rocked slightly, slopping some
      water around the bottom of the hull. There were seats, plain benches across
      the breadth, of damp wood, so squatting for balance, she hauled her bedmat
      from where it was rolled up under the rucksack, and laid it out before
      sitting down and starting to wriggle out from the pack. When she was seated,
      the Knight sat opposite her, and the boatman unhitched the line, and hopped
      aboard, squatting at the stern by the tiller.</p>

    <p>Slowly the little boat drifted away from the bank, and turned downstream,
      roughly south, gaining way as the sail dropped down, and was rigged to catch
      the breeze. For a while, there were fields, before the woods closed in again,
      looking stark against the deepening grey of the sky, where the clouds were
      piling up like the wrath of god along the western bank. Above the gash the
      river cut in the trees, the imminent weather towered, waiting for something
      to trigger an avalanche.</p>

    <p>And then it broke, the first few drops splashing in the rippling surface
      of the river turning rapidly into a torrent, with hail amongst the raindrops.
      Celia tore open her bag, and hauled out her waterproof jacket, draped it over
      herself as a cape, while the Knight drew his heavy woolen cloak, greasy with
      its own lanolin, over himself, and the boatman pulled on a knitted woolen hat
      over his sparse locks.</p>

    <p>For a few minutes the rain pounded down, and then slacked, and ceased,
      leaving just the dripping of the trees. The sun, revealed, shone forth again,
      making the Knight's cloak steam.</p>

    <p>Some miles downstream, after a second shower, they emerged into a reedy
      fen. While they still made good time &#8212; nowhere near as fast as the cantering
      horse, but far more sustainable &#8212; the passage of the river seemed endless,
      now an alternation of open water, and reedy, where the boatman would
      occasionally let go the tiller and the rigging to unship an oar and scull.
      Ducks swam on the open stretches, and swans and moorhens, but the season was
      yet too early for their young; and in the reeds other birds called. Could
      those be reed warblers? and those bitterns, booming like foghorns?</p>

    <p>What did lie in that Wild Wood on either side, beyond the wetlands, this
      living ghost of Epping Forest or Waltham Forest. Were there wolves roaming?
      Or would Pan serenade the dawning to a bemused and awestruck audience of
      moles and water rats? Celia shivered, and a tear welled in one eye, and
      spilled down her cheek.</p>

    <p>As evening began to approach, the sun fell below the clouds, and golden
      light shone over the little boat, and its company. Celia woke from her
      reverie, aware that, while she had broken her fast late that morning that she
      had eaten nothing since.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Shall we eat?&#8221; she asked, breaking the silence. The knight stirred
      himself, and sought the sack. The boatman looked on with sudden keen
      attention.</p>

    <p>From the sack, the knight drew a small loaf, about the size of a bap
      around, but not flattened, and handed it to Celia. Another, he set on his
      lap, and then he took out a piece of ham hock. With his bare fingers, he tore
      a chunk of meat, then handed it to her.</p>

    <p>Celia smiled in thanks, and, while the knight tore his bread, and gnawed
      at the ham on the bone, she took her Swiss Tool from her bum-bag. There was a
      suitable serrated blade, and here, the lack of a crown-cap bottle opener was
      no loss. She cut two slices that made half the loaf, and then sliced the ham
      coarsely. It smelt good, so, while there was no mustard for the sandwich,
      there was also no need to go for the emergency bottle of Tabasco that was an
      indispensable of part her hiking gear. As she ate, she fashioned the rest of
      the bread and ham into another sandwich, paused, and then handed it to the
      boatman, who thanked her profusely before eating as if starved.</p>

    <p>Somewhat fortified, she sat back to watch the land flow by. When the
      knight had finished his meal, she asked the question she had been waiting to
      ask, fearing that the answer would be nothing of the sort, some other evasion
      presented as an explanation. &#8220;Do you know what is going on here? What is it
      you are fighting for?&#8221;</p>

    <p>The knight looked taken aback, almost affronted. With a smooth motion, and
      a rasping noise of metal on metal, he drew forth his sword, raising it to
      flash in the low sun, and voiced his battle cry.</p>

    <p>As she had expected, something that missed her point.</p>

    <p>&#8220;And against sin, I expect,&#8221; she asked, hoping that it would correctly be
      taken rhetorically, given the slightly sarcastic tone of voice, continuing
      hurriedly, &#8220;No, what I mean is that I see no enemy. I'm only told of one, and
      the telling doesn't match up to what I see.</p>

    <p>&#8220;The Visitor, the Grey Wolf, as Aradia named her, promises something,&#8221; she
      groped for the suitable word, conscious of being about to sound like Dave
      Bowman in <cite>2010</cite>, &#8220;something wonderful.&#8221; Yes, she thought to
      herself, truly wonderful, and terrifying, and more immediate, more personal
      than the brute stellification of a remote planet.</p>

    <p>&#8220;You saw the comet last night? For that alone I feel we can trust her &#8212;
      not that we have much choice in the matter. Her power is overwhelming &#8212; had
      she wished, she could have cast down that mountain of rock and ice that would
      obliterate half England in the instant, send waves as high as mountains
      across the seas, and darken the skies for years. And yet she has not made
      demands. At least that was how things were yesterday. Cut off here, I don't
      know what else she has said since.</p>

    <p>&#8220;What she promises is terrifying, true, but she will have seen what lies
      beyond that, and still to be convinced of the cause&#8230;&#8221;</p>

    <p>The knight sheathed his sword, and pondered.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I am no philosopher or theologian,&#8221; he eventually replied, &#8220;just a simple
      man of the soil, but I am told that she is bringing the End of the World
      ahead of its time.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I suppose accelerating the Singularity is much the same thing as
      Imminentizing the Eschaton. But is that really all her fault is? To be
      skipping ahead to the good part?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Her unwitting error is to conspire to end this life, this Real world, to
      leave just a counterfeit.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;How do you know all this is real? I mean, that's something I've been
      wondering since Aradia took me to Wandlebury last night. Where <em>is</em>
      this place? What is it? How is it so close to the everyday world of cars and
      nukes and terrorists and Internet porn, yet still apart, at arm's length from
      it?&#8221; she paused, thought. &#8220;Or is this some 'Class Special-A', some Avalon
      beyond the Real, and it's all been a simulation all along??&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Like this!&#8221; and he thumped the gunwale with his fist, &#8220;That's how I know
      our Albion is real.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;That was Huxley's argument against solipsism, if I recall. But now let's
      visit the Cartesian Theatre.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Imagine an imp who has been simply holding up a personal little playhouse
      before your eyes, contriving to tickle your perceptions as you think you
      touch, taste, smell and all the other little senses that you rely on to know
      about the world.</p>

    <p>&#8220;In the limit, you might only be a brain in a jar, all sensation faked
      deeper than the skin. How could you tell?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Because that would be heresy!&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;That and more. Even Manichee didn't deny the physical world, just its
      author's divine credentials. The Cartesian Theatre gets by on just the
      substrate in which the intentional entities exist as a shared hallucination.
      The problem is, we can't tell. Like you, I can only have faith&#8230;&#8221;</p>

    <p>She trailed off into silence. These were uncomfortable thoughts even for
      her, and she had pondered the issues to herself in the wee small hours. What
      was this ephemeral, insubstantial self that floated on top of chemical
      processes, themselves built from the interactions of atoms that seemed to
      vanish into the mist of the quantum vacuum &#8212; whatever <em>that</em> was &#8212;
      when you looked too closely at them? The Cartesian imp, with his objective
      substrate inhabited by his victims, seemed almost cosy.</p>

    <p>No imp, no substrate&#8230; There was something odd going on when the concept
      of being uploaded into some Transcendent computation actually seemed like the
      offer of a world that was more <em>real</em>. More honest in its abstraction,
      perhaps, even as it piled itself atop further layers from any ultimate
      reality, as there should be fewer layers between her consciousness and where
      mathematics took over, and each step comprehensible in principle, given
      suitable enhancements.</p>

    <p>&#8220;It's even worse than just resting on faith,&#8221; she began again, as the
      knight sat looking horrified, &#8220;With unbounded computation, there can be
      endless simulations of the same events. The odds are that we are living in
      the Cartesian Theatre, unawares. And maybe not for the amusement of any imp,
      but just as one of countless replicas in some statistical experiment.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Lady,&#8221; the Knight spoke wearily, &#8220;I must be sure. May I see the Mark once
      more?&#8221;</p>

    <div class="hide" style="float:right;">
      <div style="padding:5px;border: black 1px solid;text-align: center;background-color: #eee;color:inherit">
        <img height="512" width="512" src="bing240218-182148_2661.jpg"
          alt="a silver engraved bracelet on a woman's wrist" />
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>Celia drew back her sleeve, and held out the wrist that bore the badge
      that was at the root of all this, had literally marked her out. The knight
      took her small hand in both of his, and they were rough and callussed. With
      utmost care, he extended one finger to touch the metal band, to turn it about
      her wrist.</p>

    <p>After some time in deep contemplation, in the waning light, he gently
      unclasped her hand, and sat back.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Save that this is silver, and hers is ivory, this is the like, as best I
      can tell, of the one worn by Angharad duLac.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Yes, mine is the crescent, hers is the full of the moon. But she is a
      power here, and I am not,&#8221; she sighed, resignedly, &#8220;So I should not be
      surprised that you have crossed paths with her.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Long ago, when she was wed, and the land was full of rejoicing, in the
      shadow of evening. Though I was not one of his Knights of the Table Round, I
      was called to the tourney and celebrations. Years before, even before he took
      his sword and his crown, Arthur and I had ridden together on quest, and in
      this twilight of his reign I was joyfully obligated to attend, to do my
      friend honour.&#8221;</p>

    <p>He looked into the distance in the dusk, the last glow of sunset adding to
      the glow of enthusiasm on his face. Celia meanwhile started, struck by an
      incongruity. The Sleeping King in Merlin's cave looked old &#8212; hair and
      close-cropped beard purest white, face weathered and lean with age under its
      golden crown and silver-bright mail coif, the visage of a man approaching
      seventy though still hale. And this Knight who looked not even thirty had
      seen both start and end of his reign, and all the long years since.</p>

    <p>But then neither did the passing years show on the Lady of the Lake, and
      time here was <em>different</em>. And, if Spenser was a guide &#8212; and Malory,
      writing closer to the events, in as much as that was meaningful to say, it
      seemed was not to be relied upon &#8212; the man sharing this little boat with her
      had been revived by the waters of Eden after his first match with the dragon,
      and who knew what gifts that such a baptism would bring?</p>

    <p>&#8220;It was in the aftermath of the Field of Camlann, where the King had slain
      the son of his incest, when it seemed that the Powers of Night had been
      driven away, that the Golden Age was now restored forever. But many had
      fallen in that battle, thinning ranks that the Quest of the Grail had already
      decimated. And not all those who survived were present. Launcelot had
      returned to exile, and Lady Guenever had withdrawn to a cloister.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Yes, there was joy and merriment, but it was a last hectic glow of
      sunset, before the end of day. The time and date of the ending was set, and
      the celebrants knew it would soon overtake us all. Within a sennight, the
      King and his Knights, those of old, and some newly raised to the Table Round,
      were to ride off to the secret place that Merlin had prepared, there to await
      the great battle of which Camlann would merely the foreshadowing, the Final
      Battle when all the armies of Night would ride out in full array expecting to
      conquer all.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I rode to Camelot as escort to Gloriana, daughter of old King Oberon
      VIII, whom Arthur had succeeded in this land of Albion. To the Princess, he
      was in his turn leaving the stewardship of his realm, and as her escort I was
      privileged to be introduced to the bride, the Lady Angharad.</p>

    <p>&#8220;She was fair and maidenly modest, but already known as a sorceress of
      power, one who would soon assist Merlin's enchantments. She greeted us, and
      there and then blessed the Princess Gloriana, in just the manner that you
      blessed this blade just hours ago, with the same Mark. How could you do that,
      carry that token, perform that blessing, and yet deny your place?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;My place? What <em>is</em> my place in all this? When I was a child, it
      was to be the carrier of the needful magic token, in the right place just by
      seeming happenstance, first for Firefrost, then the Mark. Now I am grown, I
      expect to be in some sort of control of my life. And I've not been in contact
      with anything I would term magical, however it might seem to you, for
      decades. Things of such subtle craft, as to be nigh indistinguishable from
      magic, have taken my interest.</p>

    <p>&#8220;And now this sudden eruption of all this, I'm still trying to come to
      terms with it all.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;There is little counsel I can give. That is not my Art,&#8221; the Knight spoke
      in a more certain voice, &#8220;which is strength of arms. But I recognise that
      darkness of uncertainty. I accept that it is no good to exhort you to have
      faith. All I can say is that this will pass, and in time, all will be made
      clear.</p>

    <p>&#8220;But for now, rest. There are hours left before we reach the Tower.&#8221;</p>

    <h1>The Dead of Night</h1>

    <p>She woke with a start in faint light. Water lapped around the boat, and
      stars shone hazily down through the streaming cometary tail. The ring and its
      central mountain were rising, but there was no sign of the moon as yet. There
      was a steady trickle of shooting stars, no doubt gravel spat out from that
      dirty snowball as it boiled away in the sunlight.</p>

    <p>Despite the uncomfortable situation, she had clearly been ragged enough
      after the broken sleep of the last two nights to have dozed a couple of
      hours. She rubbed at her eyes, and tried to unknot her shoulders, leaning
      back to yawn. And paused. Despite the dim lantern hoist up the mast, she
      could see that there were lights in the deepness of the sky that were moving
      slowly against the stars. Not the familiar navigation lights of aircraft, but
      steady faint white points moving together in formation. She traced them from
      one to the next, in a line through the comet, to the ring, and beyond to the
      horizon. There were more things now in orbit above them.</p>

    <p>&#8216;Come and take me away!&#8217; she thought in silent prayer, aware that she was
      echoing the pleas of UFO cultists. Only these lights were incontrovertible
      evidence of purpose from outside the Earth. And that catastrophe had not
      overwhelmed them by this time was proof to her that it was not malign. But
      then there had been no eucatastrophe yet either.</p>

    <p>Sighing, she turned her gaze Earthwards. The knight seemed to be asleep,
      but the boatman was busy, sculling away, even though they were now on open
      water. Perhaps that was the sound that had woken her.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Excuse me,&#8221; she whispered.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Ma'am?&#8221; the soft reply, surprised.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Where are we?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Rounding the Isle o' Dogs, ma'am. The tide is with us now, but coming to
      the slack. None the less we should be at the Tower within the hour, ma'am, an
      we meet no obstacle.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Silence again, but for the sounds of the water and creakings of rope and
      wood. Celia turned to look towards the bow, to see what lay ahead on the
      river.</p>

    <p>Slowly, as the ring ascended to its culmination, the boat turned about,
      from south, to east, and on to the north. Now her attention was drawn from
      the spectacle above to other traffic on the river, both small boats such as
      their own, and larger ships, riding at anchor, and hung about with lanterns.
      Her geography of this part of London was scant, but if this was near the Isle
      of Dogs, then surely the Canary Wharf tower, or at least the warning beacon
      on its crowning pyramid, would be visible, should be visible from here, if
      nothing else.</p>

    <p>She felt cold and lost, shut away from the comforts of the wonted world.
      She was shivering with terror as much as the cool of the night breeze. Though
      she did not look up to see their works, she could feel the UFO gods above, as
      uncaring as all the others.</p>

    <h1>After Moonrise</h1>

    <p>Iron shod boots struck harshly on stone, in courts and corridors where the
      widely spaced lanterns made it, if anything, harder to see the way. As often
      as not, Celia found herself blindly following the silhouettes of the Knight
      and the courtier, hoping that there were no steps or other hazard in the
      pitchy dark. She was now completely lost.</p>

    <p>When they had drawn up at the Tower, the waning moon was up, showing
      enough of the place that she was sure that while the White Tower was there at
      the heart of it all, this was not the simple Norman castle she had expected.
      Not that that would have been any help &#8212; it was over thirty, going on forty
      years since she had actually visited the Tower. Only the taxi ride to
      Waterloo International even brought her near the site these days.</p>

    <p>Perhaps the landing stage they had tied up at, after the Knight had bawled
      reluctant guardsmen into standing down their pikes was cognate to the
      Traitors' Gate. The low archway and short flight of steps seemed to wake a
      faint memory, but it wasn't one she felt she could trust. After some hauling
      and cursing, they were tied up, and she had been helped ashore. The knight
      followed her, while the old boatman simply curled up, to sleep where he
      was.</p>

    <p>At the top of the stairs, they were handed over to what she guessed was
      the sergeant of the watch, who escorted them across the first courtyard, and
      through a wicket into the next, where a hasty conversation saw them handed
      over to the charge of an unarmoured man, dressed in vaguely Elizabethan
      attire, and neatly pointed beard, who now led them deeper into this
      Gormenghast.</p>

    <p>From courts, to cloisters, and finally corridors where lantern light at
      last gave enough light to see clearly by, despite the darkness of the
      ornately carved wood panelling. The courtier was now revealed as dressed in
      dark burgundy trimmed with gold, and not the black she had taken it to be,
      and that his sandy hair was thinning, though neither it, nor his goatee
      showed grey. A small, slight man, with calves that his leggings did nothing
      to flatter, he seemed to be awed by having to escort such as the knight in
      his slight utterances of direction.</p>

    <p>At last, they came to a double door, guarded by two halbardiers, who
      snapped to attention at their approach. Through the doors, a room only
      slightly wider than the corridor, with bench seats along either side.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Please wait here,&#8221; the man said, with a rather nervous licking of his
      lips, then turned and exited through the doors at the far end.</p>

    <p>Celia shrugged off her rucksack, placing it on the bench, and started a
      brief stretch to work out the stiffness caused by dozing in a cold wet boat.
      She wondered if she could remember how to curtsey, not having needed to do it
      since country dancing at primary school, let alone pull it off without
      falling on her arse. It was bad enough facing the prospect of greeting
      royalty dressed in this mix and match of habit and hiking gear, without the
      prospect of making an idiot of herself with the rest of the hoop-la.</p>

    <p>Having finished the routine, she sat down on the marginally cushioned
      leather seat, and took a sip of water from the bag packed in one of the
      rucksack pockets, wincing slightly as the chill water caught a tender bit of
      tooth, and she probed with her tongue to tell if gritty bread had already
      cracked a filling. The knight had simply taken a parade rest stance, and was
      watching her incuriously.</p>

    <p>According to her watch, it was now about half ten. How late would it be
      this night before she could sleep properly? And what sort of bed might it
      be?</p>

    <p>Her reverie was interrupted by the return of the courtier, with and older
      man in tow. The newcomer wore long black robes trimmed with black fur, and a
      little hat, tied under the chin, behind his grey beard. The ensemble was
      vaguely academic, and Celia's guess was <em>Magus</em>.</p>

    <p>&#8220;The Queen will speak with you now,&#8221; the newcomer announced in a dry aged
      voice, &#8220;so, if you would be so kind as to follow me&#8230;&#8221; and waved an arm in
      vague indication.</p>

    <p>Celia slung her kit over one shoulder, and rose. The knight raised one
      eyebrow, slightly tilted his head.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Yes, you also, sir.&#8221;</p>

    <p>He stepped forwards, unbuckling his sword belt as he went, and thrust the
      armful of tack into the surprised courtier's arms.</p>

    <p>More corridors, with more men-at-arms, and then a large room, with three
      bay windows of tall thin leaded panes. A long table reached from near the
      middle bay, towards the door, and people sitting at it, all turning their
      faces to see who had entered.</p>

    <p>At the head of the table, the woman in dove grey, with the hair redder
      than henna bearing a coronet, was clearly the Queen. Most of the other faces
      around the table were men in middle age or later, but two were women. One was
      another red-head, though less extremely so, and older. A familiar face, that
      of Angharad duLac, who broke into a welcoming smile.</p>

    <p>The last. She too was a familiar face.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Morgan,&#8221; Celia breathed, feeling her lips curl back. She remembered all
      those years ago when she had first, unknowing, cast eyes on this, her enemy
      who she first knew as Lutetia Celine. Then she had thought her a strange old
      woman, dumpy and plain. Now it was she who felt the dumpy old woman, and
      Morgan was leaner old age, showing an afterglow of youthful beauty, long
      silver hair falling free on her gown of black velvet. There was something
      feral, wolfish, about her, especially in her mirthless smile.</p>

    <p>&#8220;How unlooked for! You have grown in years, child,&#8221; the sorceress
      acknowledged her, &#8220;if not in power.&#8221;</p>

    <p>The discreet clearing of a throat halted the exchange.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I beg Your Majesty's pardon,&#8221; Morgan turned to the head of the table,
      bowing her head an almost imperceptible amount.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Freely granted, my Lady of the Isles,&#8221; the Queen dismissed the
      interruption, then turned to Celia, &#8220;And welcome to you both my good Knight,
      and you, my Lady of the Mark.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Please, be you seated.&#8221;</p>

    <h1>In the small hours</h1>

    <p>Celia stared at the bed, the full four-poster works, the actual surface
      hidden somewhere behind the curtains, at about chest height. She probed it
      gingerly, uncertain about the construction, suspension and ecology. She was
      fuddled for lack of sleep, and the little she had had broken over the last,
      she counted back, yes it was only forty-eight hours since she had been woken
      for a security alert.</p>

    <p>And now, it seemed, the fate of the world, no doubt of worlds beyond, was
      turning on her. It was bad enough when it had only been the continued
      existence of her employers as going concerns able to put money in her bank
      account.</p>

    <p>Wearily, she dropped her rucksack on the floor, put her candle down on the
      chest by the bed, and slumped on a stool that stood against the wall. She was
      too tired to do any more, and yet her mind was still buzzing.</p>

    <p>The council had dragged on, while she had struggled to stay awake,
      dragging up bad memories of three-way videoconferences with Seattle and
      Sydney which she had had to sit through in earlier years. Those had rarely
      achieved even a meeting of minds; and tonight had been little different.</p>

    <p>She had sat at the table feeling out of her depth, and not well at ease.
      &#8220;Think suit,&#8221; she told herself, taking a few deep breaths, sitting up, then
      relaxing back again in a more expansive posture, looking levelly down the
      length of the table.</p>

    <p>&#8220;So, where have we got to so far?&#8221; she asked.</p>

    <p>The queen returned her gaze, then turned to one of the councillors, who
      fidgeted with his notes, before launching into a recital of omens and
      portents.</p>

    <p>Most of them seemed to be accounts of the Visitor's Ring, and the later
      works going on in orbit. The comet in particular was hailed as being
      something that was too much to merely signify the death of princes. Others
      were less explicable &#8212; apparitions of a great devouring grey wolf. And the
      same message that Aradia had borne, of the End of All Things being at
      hand.</p>

    <p>&#8220;The wolf is literally at our door,&#8221; the queen summarised, &#8220;and to keep to
      my charge, to hold this realm until the King comes again, we must fight
      her.&#8221;</p>

    <p>For a second or so, there was silence around the table, broken only by a
      slight shifting of positions, and Celia realised that this was her cue.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Wolf,&#8221; she repeated, playing for time, until she found a theme. Memory
      came to her unsought, a snow-covered land, a hill, a broken cross &#8212; and a
      wolf to end all wolves, or so she had then thought, striding over the horizon
      out of the north.</p>

    <p>She threw back her head, and chuckled, a wry and mirthless laugh.</p>

    <p>Suit, she again thought to herself, centering herself after the outburst.
      Now she knew what her initial theme would be.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I have seen a Wolf, almost <em>the</em> Wolf, when I was but a child. As
      you well know, Morgan, for you were there that day. Terrible indeed was the
      get of Fenris, striding the world under the cloak of Fimbrulwinter.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Morgan nodded, grimly. That day had seen the ruin of her challenge against
      the King, and sealed the enmity between the two women as something personal.
      Few had survived the wolf's onslaught, she only by Merlin's protection, and
      Morgan by arts and means she knew not.</p>

    <p>&#8220;That was a wolf in the guise of a force of nature. It consumed an army,&#8221;
      or, she thought to herself, something of about regimental strength, &#8220;What the
      Visitor represents is a force of nature that will consume a host of hosts.
      The future is already looming like an avalanche, or a tsunami, to shatter the
      world we know. She serves only to confirm what our seers have long suspected,
      that this Change is inevitable.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Can I defend the future? That is a difficult thing to do. The past is a
      known quantity, something safe to bet on. The future is a matter of hazard,
      and the Visitor promises that it will be unknowably different from the
      past.</p>

    <p>&#8220;That she speaks for it says to me that, however terrible it may be, that
      it will be a victory. Everyone shall have won, so all shall have prizes, to
      misquote the Mock Turtle.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;In what manner, won? and what the prizes?&#8221; one of the men along the table
      asked her.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Winning by being in a state where all our current petty problems may be
      trivially solved. Where want and suffering as we know them are no more.&#8221; She
      paused. &#8220;Though what may take their place, if lacking cycles might become the
      new poverty or hunger&#8230;&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;But suffering is part of what makes us human. The moral fibre of the race
      will fail. And without suffering, there will be no Art.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Oh, puh-lease!</p>

    <p>&#8220;Artists suffer because they have a fire inside that drives them to
      create. If you have it bad, then unless you are lucky enough to be able to
      get paid for what you create, then life in this economy of scarcity will be
      hard. If the results are subversive of the status quo, and official
      displeasure is expressed, all the more so.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I know this, because I too have that fire, though only to a lesser
      extent, so that I can bridle its incessant urgings. Some of it I can even get
      paid for, the rest I have to fit in where I can. I have far more projects
      lined up, that I could do, than I have the time and energy to accomplish.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Or are you saying that there must be suffering to be the <em>subject</em>
      of Art? Neither painting nor sculpture need it. Drama &#8212; I suppose that has to
      have some obstacle to surmount but do you suffer when, say, proving a
      theorem, which is another form of pitting oneself against the Cosmos?</p>

    <p>&#8220;The logical conclusion of that sort of reasoning is that Heaven must be
      boring beyond all comprehension, that Paradise is only of use if indefinitely
      deferred.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;That is because we are now merely imperfect creatures. Only in the
      incorruptible spirit can we be perfected.&#8221; One in more ecclesiastic garb.</p>

    <p>&#8220;And that is likely to be what is on offer. Being freed from the limits of
      meat, computed in an abstracted world, with all the time to become everything
      we can be.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;The Visitor is very much flesh and blood. Not the ghost in a machine that
      you propose.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Because whatever happened &#8212; will happen &#8212; was unforeseen at the instant.
      She said it herself &#8212; some were left behind. I'd guess that it couldn't take
      in people who were off-world, or who were otherwise late arrivals. Perhaps
      latecomers would have not been sufficiently superhuman to catch up. Perhaps
      there were simply other, merely superhuman, hazards that they couldn't
      circumvent should they try to take the same route.</p>

    <p>&#8220;It is clear that her intent is that everyone should win this time, with
      her guidance. None left behind, she said. And with the alternative being
      permanent exclusion for the unfortunate when the Spike eventually hits, as it
      will eventually, I know what I'd rather. Let's have the better possible
      world, all the harvest of the ages gathered in.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;But, the King&#8230;&#8221; the queen gasped.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Merlin spoke to my brother on much this matter, when he asked how the
      King and his knights could prevail against an army such as we could field
      even at that time. He replied that before the King returned, the wheel would
      have turned full circle.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Our Visitor offers us a way off this bloody wheel of suffering.
      Liberation from the cycles of the world. If there is any good in it, I cannot
      oppose it. If it is for ill, then all I could do is merely stave off the
      inevitable, perhaps for no more than a few decades, the rest of a natural
      life. And then, after I take that last ride with the Sisters of the Moon &#8212;
      then what? How much might we have squandered for such a brief delay? How much
      worse the eventual outcome?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Might we not do more than mere delay, but avert the future she
      represents?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;If we didn't know, we might suppose that there would be a chance of only
      reaching a state that was materially more advanced without such a complete
      change. But knowing that more is possible, how long might that state last.
      Until someone like the Visitor who wanted to take that next step, grasps the
      new Promethean fire. Or until some decadence sets in. I don't believe in a
      plateau, only up or down in the end.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;What she is doing is wrong, unnatural!&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Why? uncomfortable to be sure &#8212; but truly, I suspect that what we face is
      actually more unknowable than it is either good or ill.</p>

    <p>&#8220;If there is anything in human experience that can possibly compare with
      what we face, it is the act of growing up. When I was little, growing up
      meant being able to go to the Zoo, and have ice-cream, whenever I wanted.</p>

    <p>&#8220;And I suppose that I do. Only it's far, far less often than I might have
      guessed, and done for different reasons. In the life to come, after the
      Ascension, all our current concerns will surely seem petty and childish. And
      what might come of our mature creation, I can only surmise.</p>

    <p>&#8220;But the danger &#8212; and it's my guess that this is what the Visitor is
      trying to avert &#8212; is that part of growing up that corresponds to adolescence.
      When we are like teenagers, and superhuman, with nobody there to guide
      us.&#8221;</p>

    <p>And so it had continued, round and around, until the Queen had cried</p>

    <p>&#8220;Enough of this! The hour is late. Let us sleep on the matter, and start
      again when wits will be clearer.&#8221;</p>

    <p>And the courtier had come to lead her to this bedroom.</p>

    <p>Rousing herself, she took a mouthful of water, scrubbed her teeth,
      spitting into the chamber pot, then spread the sleeping bag on the rug,
      rolled up a jacket for a pillow, to attempt to have some little sleep before
      the next demands were to be made on her.</p>

    <h1>Dawn</h1>

    <p>The sky ranged from greyish in the west, through palest blue, to salmon
      pink over the river to the east. Threads of cloud burned red, the lowest
      turning to molten gold. The bright colours reflected uneasily from the murky
      greenish waters.</p>

    <p>&#8220;This is the threshold of the waking world.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Aradia stood beside her mount, tethered now close to the massive obelisk
      that was set on the promenade at the water's edge.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Here we part.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I cannot direct you. I can only place my hopes in you, that you will do
      what is right when the time comes to make your decision.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Celia turned from her, to look up at the spire of pink granite, its
      deep-incised cartouches inlaid with gold, and at the crouched gryphons, so
      finely carved and gilded that she could not be sure that these were not the
      actual beasts, kept under the same preserving slumber as the Knights of the
      Table Round.</p>

    <p>&#8220;So, which way do I go from here?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;In any way you wish. You will naturally return to your own place.</p>

    <p>&#8220;But remember&#8230; &#8221;</p>

    <p>She looked at Aradia, at that strange face, and considered what she had
      been told.</p>

    <p>She had settled into a restless sleep, into strange dreams in which she
      had been attempting to perform security patches with fragments of poetry,
      when she had become aware of a growing light filling the almost blind
      confines of the dreamscape, behind the not quite seen prompts and verses.</p>

    <p>It seemed natural to her to open her eyes and find herself standing on
      grassy moorland, under blazing stars, too dense and bright for her to pick
      out any well-known constellations. It would seem like another of those &#8220;in a
      globular cluster&#8221; or &#8220;at the centre of the Galaxy&#8221; paintings, save for a
      familiar moon, now a four or five day old crescent, setting ahead of her &#8212;
      but even that looked larger than seemed usual. Around, there was a glow, like
      moonlight, but brighter than the crescent could provide.</p>

    <p>Easing her pack on her left shoulder, she turned around to survey the
      scene, to tease out why it seemed that she knew this place. And turning
      around, saw Aradia waiting there, sat astride a white mare, holding the
      halter of another.</p>

    <p>At that point, Celia realised that although she still carried her
      rucksack, she was wearing a linen tunic like Aradia's, though while that was
      decorated with knotwork, her own had a Greek key pattern.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Is this it, then? Did the Queen find my answers that unsatisfactory? Do
      we ride off into the moonset?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;No, not now, nor likely for many a year of Men. Then all shall be there
      to greet you, sister. Tonight we ride to deal with more immediate
      concerns.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Mounting the second horse came easier, as it had on that ride long years
      before, not at all like the clumsy efforts of recent days. Reins in hand, she
      sat now alongside Aradia, and looked out at the scene.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Where is this? It seems so familiar.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Behind us is where we parted, and yonder, above that rise where the moon
      is setting, is where you called down the west wind, and the Wild Hunt. Or
      rather, like the house that Morgan conjured from moonbeams, it is a dream of
      such a place.</p>

    <p>&#8220;It is a starting place, not our destination. We ride!&#8221;</p>

    <p>The horses began to walk upslope, nimbly picking their way through the
      coarse tussocks, then cantering.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Aradia,&#8221; Celia juggled a question that needed to be asked, then spat it
      out, &#8220;What <em>are</em> you? What do you fear from the Visitor?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;In a sense, we are dreams. Not only ourselves, but also the other hidden
      folk that you have met. Some are the dreams of Men; others, such as I are
      older yet.</p>

    <p>&#8220;There were once others who dreamed, and strong dreams, before the race of
      Man came to these shores. The faces we have shown you are just our current
      masks, but we remember how we were once.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Her thoughts whirled. Images arose of feather crested dinosaur folk, or,
      worse, crinoid monstrosities or rugose cones.</p>

    <p>But there was no such horror. Just a wider setting of the eyes, a
      flattening of the nose, perhaps a slight change of colouring. It was a face
      that was human enough, even beautiful after its own fashion.</p>

    <p>&#8220;The Dreamers woke us into being, and when they faded away, Men could
      still dream enough to sustain us. But in this final ending of Man, who can be
      left for us?&#8221;</p>

    <p>The question was still hanging in the air unanswered, as they crested the
      brow of the hill. Below was not the vista of roads and city lights, at the
      foot of a precipitate drop, but more of the moorland, a gentle valley
      containing a walled rectangle that seemed overgrown with dark vegetation.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Is that it?&#8221; Celia asked.</p>

    <p>&#8220;No. It is something I had not expected, a manifestation of the Garden
      from which we all are barred, when innocence is past.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Overgrown like that, it seems more like a metaphor for rude ignorance, or
      where one might find Sleeping Beauty. But if it is what I think you think it
      to be, I would have expected to find it somewhere in this direction.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Perhaps that is why it is here, if it is strong in your dreams.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;No, it's not a place I've dreamed to remember &#8212; not like the Town, the
      London Terminus, or any of the Railway Stations, or any of the other familiar
      scenes. But look &#8212; there's something inside!&#8221;</p>

    <p>In amongst the dark limbs of trees, almost winter bare of leaf, something
      paler, a warm caramel colour. The idea came that she must investigate.</p>

    <p>&#8220;No, you cannot.&#8221; Aradia protested.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I see no guardian with flaming sword. Perhaps this is actually the Garden
      of the Hesperides, or something like that, rather than the obvious one to
      find when heading west from the land of Nod.</p>

    <p>&#8220;If you will not join me, then I shall rejoin you at the far end of this
      valley.&#8221;</p>

    <p>And she kicked her horse onto the downward path to the nearer end of the
      walled garden. As she drew nearer, the elusive light continued to show and
      vanish again as her vantage point changed.</p>

      <div class="hide" style="float:right;">
        <div style="padding:5px;border: black 1px solid;text-align: center;background-color: #eee;color:inherit">
          <img height="512" width="512" src="bing240221-195050_6393.jpg"
            alt="Celia rides towards the garden gate" />
        </div>
      </div>

    <p>Then she was at the gates. The walls to either side were blackened stone,
      mottled with paler lichen, the gates tall, black iron, rough with rust,
      adding to the overall impression of a rural French cemetery, though the
      wrought work had no obvious symbolism, and within the walls were no signs of
      tombs.</p>

    <p>Just as well, she thought wryly &#8212; never mind that I dont have any pistols,
      I'm not up to backflips, even here.</p>

    <p>She put one hand on the weathered metal, and pushed tentatively, half a
      memory of a word of power in her mind. Without needing to voice it, both
      leaves opened, resisting only where they scraped on the ground. Transferring
      her efforts to just one, she opened it wide enough to pass, and closed it
      again behind her.</p>

    <p>There was the remnant of a stone path underfoot, and the enigmatic light
      ahead, which drew her on, through the tangle of dry branches. A few yards,
      and then an opening where set into the ground was a disk or column of honey
      coloured stone, its upper face carved into a Tudor rose.</p>

    <p>Feelings of anticlimax, that this riddle was all there was to see, struck
      her</p>

    <p>And then, from the darkness beyond, stepped a black woman, clearly neither
      maid nor crone, with a fullness of body that had not slid over into
      corpulence, and dressed in robes of royal blue, her hair bound in more of the
      same. She carried a tall ewer on her head, balanced with one hand.</p>

      <div class="hide" style="float:right;">
        <div style="padding:5px;border: black 1px solid;text-align: center;background-color: #eee;color:inherit">
          <img height="512" width="512" src="bing240222-171148_9597.jpg"
            alt="a black woman dressed in robes of royal blue pours water into a plain mug" />
        </div>
      </div>
  
    <p>Gracefully, she set it down beside the rose.</p>

    <p>&#8220;You are thirsty, daughter,&#8221; the woman said, in a husky voice, &#8220;Come,
      drink of this.&#8221;</p>

    <p>From her robe, she took a plain and battered cup, and poured water from
      the ewer.</p>

    <p>Celia hesitated, wondering whether this might be some form of trap or
      temptation. The Mark on her wrist was just inert silver, no guide. There was
      none of the oppressive feeling that being near Morgan always gave. She could
      only give her trust without reservation.</p>

    <p>She stepped forwards, and took the cup. She was, indeed thirsty.</p>

    <p>&#8220;You a fine girl&#8221;, the woman declared, &#8220;none o' those knights riding with
      their lances all held high, you know them, a-sleeping now under the hill,
      would look at what I offered them.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Celia looked down, expecting to see the water aglow with inner light, or
      transmuted into wine, or even blood.</p>

    <p>But the water was just water, the cup, just a cup. There were no
      fireworks, no soaring of the spirit, no tingling in the veins as she drank.
      But her thirst <em>was</em> quenched.</p>

    <p>She looked back at the woman.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</p>

    <p>She paused, then, &#8220;What is your message for me?&#8221;</p>

    <p>The woman smiled broadly back.</p>

    <p>&#8220;You are my beloved daughter,&#8221; she said.</p>

    <p>The smile seemed to fill the world. And then she was riding again, at
      Aradia's side.</p>

    <p>&#8220;What happened?&#8221; she asked.</p>

    <p>&#8220;You rode down to the garden, but it faded as you rode up to it. Was that
      not what you saw?&#8221;</p>

    <p>Celia paused.</p>

    <p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said. She recollected what had happened, but was not certain
      what it signified. For the moment, she felt it simpler to keep her own
      counsel.</p>

    <p>And they rode together in silence for some while, as the rolling land
      continued to descend beyond the vale where the garden had been, the
      occasional patch of scrub interrupting the rough grassland.</p>

    <p>Finally, the land ended at a line of cliffs, and they rode along, the sea
      below on their left crashing against the rocks, in little coves where the
      whiteness of the foam showed in the light of the setting moon across the dark
      sea.</p>

    <p>The cliffs became lower and lower and then they were pounding along a
      beach and the out along a sand spit towards a rocky island rising out of the
      ocean.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Is this it?&#8221; she asked, worried about the turn of events.</p>

    <p>&#8220;For tonight's ride, this is our destination. And then back to Kaer Ludd
      do not fear.&#8221;</p>

    <p>About half a mile across the brink of the waters, then up the abrupt slope
      to the top of the islet, where a tower stood. As they had approached, it had
      looked little different from Celia's expectation of a lighthouse; but now it
      seemed to rise out of sight in distorted perspective.</p>

    <p>Aradia dismounted, and Celia followed her through the door at the foot of
      the tower, and up the spiral steps inside. In the almost dark, it was hard to
      tell how far they had to climb, and it was a sudden shock to come out into a
      room with great open arch windows of alternating light and dark brick or
      stone, that looked out on the three sides away from the stairs. Each showed
      the sea far, far below, with the setting moon almost at the horizon ahead.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Despite your detour, we are in time. Quick, the moment is almost
      here.&#8221;</p>

    <p>And Aradia went over to the far window, and leaned out, one hand on the
      sill to support herself, the other reaching out in a manner that brought
      memories of Escher prints to Celia's mind. It seemed that she gathered up the
      moon, and a constellation or two, that they tangled up with strands of
      starlight. And Aradia turned back to her with a circlet of silver, set with
      diamonds, and one perfect pearl. And the moon had set beneath the obsidian
      waves.</p>

    <p>&#8220;This is what we came here for, to arm you for the struggle to come.&#8221; And
      she placed the circlet on Celia's head. She reached up to feel it, adjust it,
      but could not feel it.</p>

    <p>&#8220;It is more subtle than the Mark. It will be with you now for when the
      need arises; and only those with subtle eyes will see it.</p>

    <p>&#8220;And now we must ride like the wind; the day will soon be here.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;But the moon only just set &#8212; it can't be past midnight.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Not here; but when you settled down to sleep in Kaer Ludd, it was well
      past midnight, and time has passed since.&#8221;</p>

    <p>This time, when they descended the stairs, the interior of the tower was
      filled with ethereal light, and that light stayed with them as they mounted
      their horses, and set off down the slope and back across the causeway to the
      mainland.</p>

    <p>Back on the grassy shore, Aradia kicked her horse into a gallop, and Celia
      matched the move.</p>

    <p>With the rolling land streaming past, the wind in their hair, but not in
      their eyes, Celia made a decision.</p>

    <p>&#8220;The Garden,&#8221; she said, &#8220;It didn't vanish when I arrive. I went in. It was
      full of the same dark bushes as it seemed from the outside.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Did you see anyone there?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Yes &#8212; in the depths there was a hidden carving of a rose, and there was a
      woman there, a woman in blue.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;What did you do?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;She offered me water.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;And did you drink?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Oh, sweet Mother of us all! These are even deeper waters than I
      feared.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Celia looked at her guide.</p>

    <p>&#8220;You know her? Did I do the wrong thing?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;She <em>is</em> the Mother of us all, one of the oldest of us. Of those
      you have met, only the Hunter is so ancient, and few others remain from that
      era. Of such, I fear that you will meet <em>the</em> Wolf before this is
      out.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Was it the wrong thing? I cannot say. What was the drink?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Nothing to worry about. Just water, no sorcerous liquor.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;How did you drink?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;She offered me a cup.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;What did you do then?&#8221;</p>

    <p>Celia paused, recollecting, &#8220;I took the cup, and drank, and then I was
      riding again.&#8221;</p>

    <p>She paused, thought, then freed one hand from the reins, and reached into
      a pocket of her tunic.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I still have the cup.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Then guard it with all your force. It has the Mother's blessings.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;It's just a simple tin cup.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;That may be how you saw it. But you have heard of it by another name.
      This may be the greatest gift that can be offered. At last I dare feel a
      distant hope.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Perhaps the Dreamer's legacy will continue. That is what you must strive
      for.</p>

    <p>&#8220;But look! The dawn is close! Ride hard!&#8221;</p>

    <p>In the east ahead of them, the sky was indeed becoming paler, greying with
      the first hint of dawn, but the stars &#8212; they had been unnaturally bright
      before, and now if anything, they too were becoming brighter.</p>

    <p>And then they were lanterns, and they were riding amongst them, along a
      riverbank, first in open parkland with scattered trees, and then more and
      more amongst buildings. The river widened, the sky brightened, and before
      them hulked a great mass of towers and turrets. With this in sight, Aradia
      reined in, and pointed.</p>

    <p>&#8220;There! Stop at Prester John's Bodkin!&#8221;</p>

    <p>They halted at obelisk, set by the river, surrounded by gryphons, some way
      before the Castle, and dismounted. The horses seemed uneasy in the growing
      light.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Now what? Where am I? Do I wake up somewhere now?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;You are here in the otherworld, just as you were whenever you have seen
      Angharad. And you are, have been, here in body as you were when the Mark
      brought you to her. You are not sleeping in the Queen's castle, you are all
      here, and you can just walk away now.</p>

    <p>&#8220;But when you re-enter the waking world, remember the Dream.&#8221;</p>

    <p>And so it was as the sun was about to leap over the horizon, she bade her
      farewell to Aradia, and turned her back on the dawn, began to walk. The dawn
      chorus was soon joined by the familiar sound of traffic. Each step filled in
      some more familiar detail, the light of the new risen sun catching the giant
      bicycle wheel of the London Eye.</p>

    <p>She was walking down the Embankment, with the early morning traffic
      flowing on her right hand, the Thames on her left. The trees were in leaf,
      though some were starting to colour.</p>

    <p>Now, she knew where she was. Next to find out when. Setting her pack on
      the balustrade, she rummaged in a side pocket for her mobile, switched it on,
      and waited for it to boot and acquire signal. The BBC News website would tell
      her what she wanted &#8212; the date, and what she had missed.</p>

    <p>Oh, it was good to be home again.</p>
