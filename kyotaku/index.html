    <h2>Introductory ramble (c2004)</h2>

    <p>I never thought I'd write some outright fanfic &#8212; especially for tricky
      subjects such as the Lovely Angels, but here it is. The stories started out
      in the action movie/comedy thriller mode, when, one evening, inspiration
      struck &#8212; Let's entwine them in a movie that involves property damage on a
      moderate scale, and have them take over the plot And from there, things
      snowballed.</p>

    <p>The thought had earlier crossed my mind of maybe writing a homage
      involving an alternate universe set of characters as a homage to the Lovely
      Angels (they &#8212; with obvious mappings &#8212; would be Kay Black and Julie Silver,
      aka Team Heavy Metal aka Disaster Area). But that went nowhere. The problem I
      realised is that my usual run of female character is very much the "<a
        href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010425073333/http://www.white-crane.com/Schmitz/Neutral_heroine.htm">neutral
        heroine</a>" modelled closely on Jim Schmitz' Telzey Amberdon, whose gender
      is very much a secondary aspect of the character; whereas much of the broad
      humour in the Lovely Angels is their head-on assault on feminine stereotypes
      &#8212; girly Yuri, tomboy Kei &#8212; and the fact that they are interested in men.
      Tricky.</p>

    <p>But then I stumbled across some of the <!-- a
        href="http://www.shoujoai.com/fanfics/?series=dirtypair&amp;fanfic=comeback&amp;parte=1" -->
      more poignant DP fanfic<!-- /a --> out there, and its intensity seems to have worked its way into my
      writings. And resolved some of the other problems.</p>

    <p>I first discovered the <cite>Dirty Pair</cite> way back (1988) when the
      first comics by Adam Warren were published by Eclipse &#8212; not being in the US,
      I'd not had obvious access to any of the earlier Japanese material &#8212; and I'd
      remained a quiet fan since, picking up all their later comic-book adventures.
      Since I started running a dual-boot Windows/Linux box, the two different
      hostnames for the two aspects were always kei (Linux) and yuri (Windows).
      Then in autumn '03, I finally gave in to watching DVDs on the home computer
      and picked up the first <cite>Dirty Pair Flash</cite> region 2 DVD to add to
      the &#8212; then small &#8212; collection. And it's all been downhill from there &#8212; Amazon
      has a lot to answer for.</p>

    <p>The <cite>Dirty Pair</cite> are, of course, creations of Haruka Takachiho,
      (copyright to him and Studio Nue) without whom none of this would have been
      possible; this blatantly derivative work is offered up as a humble
      acknowledgement that he hit on something wonderful.</p>

    <!-- p>18-Jul-04 &#8212; I'm honoured to note that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130116133800/http://igarashi.burst.net/dp/fanfics/fanfic.htm">Igarishi 
is now linking to me</a> &#8212; but this page isn't really <cite>DP-Flash</cite> as such, much
more an Adam Warren DP, even if some Flash elements creep in along with
the original OAV.</p -->

    <h2>Index</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p><a href="dieslowly.html" accesskey="1" title="access key Alt-1">Die
            slowly</a> &#8212; this is the one that set the ball rolling, and sprang from
          watching <cite>Die Hard</cite> on DVD not that long after the Dirty Pair.
          And I thought "this has enough gratuitous property damage that is seems
          just the sort of things the girls would do. And wouldn't it put Bruce
          Willis' nose out of joint to be upstaged by a mere slip of a girl (or
          two)". So the girls wander into a transposition of that plot &#8212; and
          actually end up with a lower body count than in the movie. It probably
          helps if you remember the original.</p>
        <p>Here the Angels are from about <cite>Sim Hell</cite> stage, or maybe a
          bit later, in the Adam Warren comics. I'm rather partial to the cool tech
          &#8212; ok, let's not beat about the bush &#8212; the cool firepower that he gives
          the girls. But the costumes are much closer to the
          <cite>Biohazards</cite> or even the <cite>Original Dirty Pair</cite> OAV
          [not the <cite>Run from the Future</cite> Emma Frost style spray-ons]. As
          to the rest of the look &#8212; well, I do find the <cite>Flash</cite> version
          of Kei appealing &#8212; enough so that I may have to betray my original
          loyalty to the <cite>Biohazards</cite> version of Miss Yuri...
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><a href="revenge.html" accesskey="2" title="access key Alt-2">Best
            served cold...</a> &#8212; another "<cite>Dirty Pair</cite> go to the movies".
          This time the source material is actually a Jacobean revenge tragedy
          (economically named <cite>The Revenger's Tragedy</cite>) of uncertain
          authorship (probably Thomas Middleton). At the time, nearly 400 years
          ago, the play was condemned as the work of a diseased mind &#8212; with a full
          quota of rape, incest, some unnamed quasi-necrophiliac perversion
          involving a skull and a mannequin, fratricide and just plain murder, it
          just goes to show that what twenty-odd years ago would have been termed a
          "video nasty" is not a modern invention.</p>
        <p>I encountered the play when it was filmed by Alex Cox (also
          responsible for <cite>Repo Man</cite>) in 2002 (and now <a
            href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000DCY02/ref=sr_aps_dvd_1_1/026-5684230-3378008">available
            on DVD</a>). He had transposed the film from the default mythic Italy of
          much Elizabethan/Jacobean writings to Liverpool in a dark near-future.</p>
        <p>On the face of it, it doesn't seem promising material for the Lovely
          Angels, but one of the throwaway bits of Cox' transposition gave such a
          tempting opportunity for a truly characteristic disaster that it cried
          out for being so used.</p>
        <p>This is Yuri, probably not that long after <cite>Biohazards</cite>
          given the restricted technology I allow her, solo. Kei may be absent from
          the story (to balance the canonically Kei-centred previous work) but is
          never too far from Yuri's thoughts.</p>
        <p>All other parts are played by members of the movie cast.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><a href="kei-1.html" accesskey="3" title="access key Alt-3">All by
            myself</a> &#8212; this is a short mood piece, that came out of my trying to
          get a deeper grasp of the dynamics between the two characters, and teases
          on the edge of the <i>yuri</i> genre.</p>
        <p>This is Kei in the same time frame as the previous story, while Yuri
          is flying solo.</p>
        <p><strong><a href="kei-1.html">Spoiler/behind-the-scenes exposition
              ahead &#8212; go read the story first</a></strong></p>
        <p>There's a question of what is canon. I take <cite>Daatiipea no
            daibouken</cite> &#8212; or at least the English translation that's on-line
          <!-- (on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040603071540/http://igarashi.burst.net/dp/novels/dpnoveltxt.zip">Igarashi's DP
    shrine site</a>) &#8212; -->as
          the purest source, the Adam Warren version next (though I ignore the
          internal dates and assume that the tech escalation implies a correlation
          of time passing in both real and story worlds &#8212; it's probably well after
          the 2141 of <cite>Biohazards</cite> by <cite>Run from the Future</cite>),
          then the OAVs and finally <cite>Flash</cite>. Those I'll use stuff from
          it it fits the need at hand &#8212; or fills a gap in the previous sources; the
          rest of the existing source material I've not seen or found in a language
          I can read according to the medium. There is one big glitch in the list
          of sources listed as canon &#8212; the girls' clairvoyance &#8212; which can't be
          smoothed over; and I'll tend towards the original on this one, and have
          them be psychically linked, that on occasion gives them some sort of
          added insights even though having psi powers as well as high tech does
          deal them what could be too powerful a hand (<a href="../MovingDay/index.html">Why hello, Nancy!</a>)
        </p>
        <p>At that level there has to be an attraction between them, that keeps
          them together despite their stormy relationship. And that &#8212; or rather
          Kei's experience of that &#8212; is what this piece covers. Why is their
          relationship so stormy? Well, I don't try to analyse that in this
          first-person account. But the idea I have in mind is of the relationship
          between Chris Kinnison and any one of his sisters in <cite>Children of
            the Lens</cite> &#8212; that when they are together, they rub each other up the
          wrong way because their psychic fields overlap so much.</p>
        <p>And holding that thought &#8212; there are some implications in that latter
          which are pretty blatant when one stops and thinks about it. And in the
          present context there is some wriggle room for parallel developments too
          &#8212; while the canon does make some <i>yuri</i> relevant
          statements,
          it does not affirm that the Lovely Angels are <em>exclusively</em>
          straight. While we do see Yuri fending off Carvalho in <cite>A Plague of
            Angels</cite>, Kei's behaviour towards Yuri at the end of <cite>Fatal,
            but not Serious</cite> &#8212; especially in that very last scene &#8212; is
          consistent with the mood of this little piece.</p>

          funeral. Fits in before the last two pages of <cite>Fatal, but not
            Serious</cite>. More unrequited <i>yuri</i>.</p>
        <p>Characters are drafted in from the OVA and <cite>Flash</cite> series
          (the Chief is more Garner than any other holder of the role) to perform
          some supporting roles. There's also a strong streak of <cite>Flash</cite>
          in how Kei turns out. She's drifting a bit towards being Vinga Red Woman
          in SF clothing &#8212; the woman who can't take the demands of a woman's role
          and has settled for the lesser effort of taking on that of a man, but is
          none the less a fierce protector of those she cares for.</p>
