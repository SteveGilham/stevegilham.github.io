    <h2> &#8212; or &#8220;Just Another TroCon's Holiday&#8221;</h2>
    <p>This is what we did on our vacation. We'd finally been granted some time
      off, and had taken off in the <cite>Lovely Angel</cite> to the backwater
      planet of Calafia, chi Fornax III, looking for some sun and surf on the
      famous beaches of its Northern continent. What no-one told us until we got
      there was that it was currently winter in that part of the world, which
      rather put a dampener on our plans.</p>

    <p>But it wasn't all bad &#8212; Calafia is far enough out in the boonies that our
      reputation had not preceded us, so we could sample a little of the high life.
      And the studs &#8212; though Yuri was soon singing the old time complaint &#8220;Why are
      all the cute ones gay?&#8221;</p>

    <p>It was that dead time between the early sunset, and the start of the
      evening proper, and we were on board the <cite>Lovely Angel</cite> having a
      good therapeutic bitching session, when the scanner picked up a call on one
      of the local emergency bands. Some guy was talking about hostages and
      missiles, and some jobsworth in the local planetary police was telling him to
      clear that frequency.</p>

    <p>Not only are we in the 3WA all too aware of the reluctance of the local
      plods to get off their amply padded behinds, but that sounded exactly like
      our sort of party. And no-one had remembered to send us an invite! So there
      was no decision to make &#8212; of course we'd crash it. We'd help out, and show
      this sleepy old world how to deal with this sort of trouble.</p>

    <p>Yuri just grabbed her GM pack and headed off. I was a few seconds
      behind,since I stopped by my cabin to pick up some toys. Airhead might think
      that she can deal with any problem by using a small arm or her cuteness, but
      I'm happier when I'm able to try overwhelming firepower as well. And it is
      one of the perks of a TroCon's job to have the chance to use &#8212; and abuse &#8212;
      some way cool cutting edge tech &#8212; so why waste the opportunity, I say.</p>

    <p>The address the guy on the radio had cited turned out to be a couple of
      miles inland, a 100&#8211;150 meter office tower. Close enough that it took well
      under a minute to get there, but long enough to reconfigure our outfits into
      the regular uniforms. And close enough that the dialogue of the deaf between
      our guy and the cops was still going on, letting us spot the source of the
      transmissions as the very top of the tower.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Hello, sir,&#8221; I heard Yuri's voice over our tactical channel. &#8220;I'm 3WA
      Trouble Consultant Yuri. What seems to be the problem.&#8221;</p>

    <p>I was close enough now to see that she was addressing a half-dressed, buff
      looking guy who was carrying a communicator, and an automatic weapon. He was
      also looking dumbstruck &#8212; but then it's not every day that a literal lovely
      angel drops from the skies in answer to your prayers, is it.</p>

    <p>Studly guy was taking a deep breath ready to tell his story, when company
      arrived. Four of them, armed and dangerous. Three scattered along walkways
      surrounding the central raised platform that tipped the tower, the fourth, a
      frothing long-haired type came for a direct assault.</p>

    <p>Stud dived off the platform, rolled, recovered, and started to run around
      the lower level, spraying suppressive fire. Yuri did her usual little dance,
      and followed, pacing him at about shoulder height. Meanwhile long-hair
      crossed the platform at an angle, looking to get ahead and above our guy. So
      I sighed, and unshipped the Faber LA-37 I'd packed to try out.</p>

    <p>The Faber is the latest cool toy I picked up from stores. All the
      advantages of a directed energy weapon, plus all the advantages of a grenade
      launcher, in one assault rifle sized package. I selected burst fire, and let
      him have it. As I loosed the burst, my GM pack automatic evasion cut in as
      some stray fire came my way, making me miss long-hair, and blow a large hole
      in the cladding below the platform.</p>

    <p>After-action forensic reports conclusively prove that what happened next
      was not our fault. How were we to know that some idiot had mined the whole
      roof? A mighty series of detonations swept around the whole top of the tower,
      lifting the central platform, and then letting it settle into the fire. The
      wash of heat would have done horrible things to my hair, if I wasn't using
      the standard flameproofing mousse. As it was, the heat was probably not doing
      my skin much good.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Kei! Help!&#8221; The shout on the tactical band brought me back to the moment.
      I looked around, and spotted her on my HUD, descending rapidly towards the
      ground below. &#8220;He's too heavy!&#8221;</p>

    <p>Ooops! Both of them must have been blown off the tower by the force of the
      blast &#8212; and the guy we were rescuing probably massed about as much as the
      pair of us put together, what with all that muscle. No wonder Yuri's GM pack
      wasn't coping with the load. I spun round and power dived to catch up with
      them.</p>

    <p>Together, in what could have shaped up into a cosy threesome, we had just
      about enough lift to check the fall, though we did end up in a heap on the
      flat roof of a one storey ancillary building at the foot of the main
      tower.</p>

    <p>Getting to my feet, I looked back up from where we had fallen. The
      building was burning like a candle, but didn't look like it would fail
      catastrophically any time soon. In our line of business you soon learn to
      gauge these things. The fire might just get the planetary cops moving,
      though.</p>

    <p>&#8220;My wife's up there!&#8221; Our guy shouted as he saw what had happened.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Why are the cute ones always married!&#8221; Yuri shot at me over the
      tactical.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Just to make it a change.&#8221; I quipped.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Well, sir,&#8221; I continued aloud, &#8220;we can't fly you back up there, so we'll
      have to use the front door.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I'll do that!&#8221; Yuri snapped, and hopped off the flat roof, to walk across
      the darkened plaza towards the main entrance of the tower.</p>

    <p>There was some chatter on the radio. From our guy's communicator, a voice,
      suave, urbane, and with an off-world accent.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Are you still there, my friend?&#8221;</p>

    <p>He was about to take the communicator and answer, when I caught his
      hand.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Keep them guessing,&#8221; I hissed.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I'll assume that you are still out there,&#8221; the voice continued. &#8220;Not that
      it makes any difference.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;That's the leader,&#8221; he confirmed my guess.</p>

    <p>&#8220;And he doesn't know about us.&#8221;</p>

    <p>By this time Yuri was getting close to the building. This prompted more
      chatter.</p>

    <p>Voice: &#8220;Sir, there's a girl in a bikini approaching the main doors.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Voice: &#8220;That's a 3WA TroCon.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Leader: &#8220;Waste her. No half measures.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Voice: &#8220;All ready, sir.&#8221;</p>

    <p>It's at times like these that I do have to admire Yuri's grace under
      pressure. She was out there in the open with no real way to defend herself,
      while I was scanning the building for threats.</p>

    <p>There. About six floors up, IR traces, an open window, and a large caliber
      weapon being brought to bear. Now there are times, I will admit, that Yuri
      and I don't get on, but even then, if anyone's going to kill her, I'm first
      in line.</p>

    <p>The after action report conclusively showed that the destruction of the
      sixth floor of the tower was an inevitable result of the large stockpile of
      heavy ordnance the the perps had put together. Maybe not as spectacular a
      blast as the roof-top, but I was still impressed by the result.</p>

    <p>The echoes of the blast were still rolling when a burst of gunfire tore
      out of the lobby. Yuri just grabbed altitude, while I bailed off the roof,
      ignoring the guy we'd rescued shouting about his wife. I put a burst from the
      Faber into what remained of the lobby doors, slung it, and drew Mjolnir.
      Sure, it's only a standard GM wand, but useful at close quarters. Pumped up
      high, it would shield me from hostile fire and debris on the approach run.</p>

    <p>There was one figure in the lobby, dressed as a security guard, but firing
      a pistol at me like ammo never ran out. I headed his way, didn't bother
      stopping until the far wall impeded our further progress. I was just starting
      to pick myself up from a tangle with this now sleeping beauty when I heard
      footsteps behind me.</p>

    <p>I switched to gun-cam mode on my XTC pistol. Two perps with automatic
      weapons, one casually discarding some candy wrapper, still chewing on the
      sweet. The other one laughed coarsely. Neither looked alert to fire.</p>

    <p>This is intentional. When he has a crucial babe sprawled out before him,
      the average human perp will still think with his dick. Like a dick, I'd say.
      So I gave them what they wanted. The XTC gun dropped them both, with no harm
      done, except for the embarrassing stains in their next loads of laundry.</p>

    <p>While they were still twitching, I taped them up, along with the first
      guy, and slapped a Drug-a-Thug&trade; on each of them.</p>

    <p>Now I needed altitude &#8212; and a quick deep-radar scan showed a main
      ventilation shaft running up the core of the building. As I was blasting my
      way there, there was more radio.</p>

    <p>Leader: &#8220;I'm speaking to the 3WA Trouble Consultant. We have thirty
      hostages up here, and we're not afraid to start killing them. Listen.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Voice: &#8220;John, if that's you out there, tell the TroCon to stop. They
      already shot our boss.&#8221; He went on, but I stopped listening. The voice was
      smug, but tinged with fear.</p>

    <p>I switched on full tactical feed from Yuri while I powered up the
      ventilation shaft. She was now reaching a lit level, about 30 floors up. In
      the office she approached, we could see two men, one sat at a desk with his
      back to us, the other, across the desk, wearing a suit that said in a very
      expensive way &#8220;I have more money than style&#8221; facing us.</p>

    <p>He looked tense, lit up on some euphoriant, and slimy. Clearly the owner
      of the second voice. His eyes bulged as Yuri rose into view, posed demurely
      hands behind her back, head charmingly tilted..</p>

    <p>I was up level with her by now, fighting my way through ducts barely large
      enough for my figure, trying to find a way out into a sensible place to
      act.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Hello, Sir&#8221; Yuri poured on her little girl act. &#8220;Here I am. Please don't
      do anything to hurt anyone.&#8221;</p>

    <p>The lead perp turned. He was also a dreamboat. &#8220;Why is it,&#8221; I
      signalled, &#8220;that the cute ones are all villains?&#8221; From his reactions, we
      judged that he would not hesitate to kill &#8212; but that he would think before
      doing so. That half a second delay meant that he was no threat. No, that was
      the guy outside the office.</p>

    <p>I could see him directly now, myself, over what had been a large function
      room with exquisite decor, and even a water feature. Of course by now it had
      suffered some fire damage &#8212; though the sprinkler system seemed to have dealt
      with that. Between us was a miserable huddle of damp civilians that he was
      keeping watch over, with his automatic weapon at the ready.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Pete,&#8221; said the leader to the lone perp, keeping his attention, and his
      aim, on Yuri, &#8220;Take this thing away.&#8221; a wave of his hand indicating creepy Mr
      Too-much-money.</p>

    <p>&#8220;And you, now, miss. Hands where I can see them. This pistol is powerful
      enough that the window will offer no more resistance than your lily white
      skin.&#8221;</p>

    <p>The perp with the hostages turned, and I was about to drop him when Yuri
      signalled &#8220;Wait!&#8221; I still kept him covered as he went into the office,
      dragged Mr Too-much-money from the leather chair into which he had sunk, and
      started to prod him back to the others.</p>

    <p>Aloud Yuri simpered, and continued, hands to face, &#8220;Such compliments. And
      we haven't even been introduced.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I'm 3WA Trouble Consultant Lovely Angel Yuri, and you are&#8230;?&#8221;</p>

    <p>It was beautiful to watch. You could see the synapses firing. He half
      mouthed our loathed nickname. The wheels turned further.</p>

    <p>&#8220;It's a trap! There are *two* of them!&#8221;</p>

    <p>The perp with the machine gun swung round, his aim going nowhere in
      particular, and at that point I let him have it with the XTC pistol. It also
      caught Too-much-money, but I reckon that his cleaning bill would still be the
      cheapest way he was going to score that evening.</p>

    <p>Yuri meanwhile soared out of sight of the leader, inverted, ducked back
      down for a quick peek, and snapped a shot from her XTC at him, the last one
      standing.</p>

    <p>I stepped from the corridor where I'd been taking cover.</p>

    <p>&#8220;3WA, folks. Party's over. Please evacuate the premises in an orderly
      fashion, while I secure the perps.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Most of them headed for the stairs, but one a woman in red, headed
      straight for me. &#8220;We've got a pregnant woman here. She won't be able to
      manage the stairs all the way down.&#8221;</p>

    <p>She was right, too. Well gravid, lying on a couch. That gave me an idea
      for covert transport of 3WA gear, which I filed away for later. &#8220;Chin up,
      dear. I've just got to wrap up these perps, and then I'll call for
      transport.&#8221;</p>

    <p>It doesn't take long for a couple of dozen well motivated people to make
      themselves scarce, and to secure a couple of thugs. In the silence that had
      descended, I could now hear the local police arriving. Standing by the
      window, I watched their approach, all blues and twos, while I went through
      the formalities of getting a remote lift-off filed for the <cite>Lovely
        Angel</cite>.</p>

    <p>At that point a chime sounded, lift doors opened, and an inarticulate
      snarl broke the peace. I turned, to see the long-haired creep from the roof &#8212;
      looking rather the worse for wear and well out of it on some berserker
      reaction, natural or purchased &#8212; spray fire in my direction. Fortunately, I
      still had Mjolnir, but I'd put my Faber down when checking on the civilians &#8212;
      and this guy looked too far out of it for the XTC to work at all quickly.
      While I was wondering what the hell to do, and with ricochets chewing up the
      scenery, I heard the distinctive sound of the Faber. It makes a very
      particular sort of &#8220;ka-boom!&#8221;</p>

    <p>In his berserk state, Long-hair seemed to shrug off the first shot. The
      rest of the clip delivered on full auto was a different story. I turned. It
      was the woman in red.</p>

    <p>&#8220;That's for my husband, you bastard!&#8221; she yelled, still holding the
      trigger down long after the gun was empty.</p>

    <p>I went to take the Faber off her &#8212; and put two and two together. &#8220;Your
      husband &#8212; buff dude, knows how to handle himself in a firefight?&#8221;</p>

    <p>She thought for a moment &#8220;Well, yes, I suppose he is.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Oh, we left him downstairs somewhere. Not even slightly singed. Here,
      have a spare clip, while I go look for any other left-overs.&#8221;</p>

    <p>After that, it was an anticlimax. A quick deep radar showed just the one
      stray perp on this floor, on past the lifts, so I advanced on him, XTC in one
      hand, Mjolnir in the other. I found him working some gizmo at what looked
      like a vault door.</p>

    <p>He heard me approach, and without turning cheerfully announced &#8220;Three
      down, sir, four to go.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Wrong answer, wonderboy. It's only one to go.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Then he turned and looked at me; and he was no older than me, and very
      probably less. Certainly he was not prepared to face the wrath of a vengeful
      goddess, i.e. me. Instead, he looked like he was going to cry or call for his
      mom. I <em>hate</em> it when they do that.</p>

    <p>So I decked him cleanly, and left him for the cops.</p>

    <p>And that's how we spent <em>that</em> holiday.</p>
