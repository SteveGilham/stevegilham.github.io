    <h1>After the Fire</h1>
  </div>

  <div id="upperblaze" class="kei">
    &nbsp;</div>

  <div id="content">
    <p>They don't give you training for days like these.</p>

    <p>Sure, there are the orientation courses that take you through all the
      likely downsides of the job. But nothing quite as weird as this. And nothing
      that really tells you what it will be like when it happens.</p>

    <p>So I'm standing here, knowing I don't look good in black, especially the
      long drapy thing Mme. Beryl came up with for me, feeling like a sack done up
      in the middle, and wondering what I should be doing and thinking.</p>

    <p>Life has been good for me and such of my family as I still keep in touch
      with, and the UG makes sure that there's enough medical cover for modern
      treatments that I'd been able to live my life to date without having to
      attend a funeral. What a one to start out with.</p>

    <p>The Syncretist Neo-Shinto priest in all the robes is intoning away in high
      flown Japanese, and despite all efforts, I've simply not managed to do more
      than get to the tourist getting by stage in that language. I'd probably
      understand more of what he's going on about if it were the padre that
      great-gran always insisted on dragging me off to, when I was just an
      ankle-biter, doing the whole thing in Latin &#8212; and that is all Greek as far as
      I'm concerned.</p>

    <p>Her father is standing opposite me, across the grave, a small man, who has
      let his hair grey at the temples to get the distinguished look that a
      mid-ranking functionary needs. Her mother is holding on to his arm. He has a
      dark suit, she has a kimono that she's now too dumpy to look dignified in.</p>

    <p>Neither of them has met my glance.</p>

    <p>They still blame me for taking their little flower and leading her astray
      &#8212; and that was back when we were freshman students. That's ancient history &#8212;
      heck, I wasn't even me, the me I am now, back then. Barely more than a na&iuml;ve
      little kid myself.</p>

    <p>Two of her older brothers, standing behind them. They look like they could
      be enforcers for the yakuza in their dark suits and slicked hair. Today, for
      the first time, they're not looking at me like they want to get into my
      drawers. There's anger and bewilderment in their looks and posture
      instead.</p>

    <p>On my side, the Chief, standing there with that worried expression he
      always has whenever we see him, fidgeting with the collar of his shirt; and
      Mme. Beryl looking like everyone's favourite sainted aunt. But then she must
      have attended every TroCon's funeral for longer than I care to think about &#8212;
      and while the CC doesn't circulate the numbers, in our line of work, that'll
      be a very large number. I hear she even invited herself to Deirdre's &#8212; and
      <em>she</em> had wanted that to just be a personal affair.
    </p>

    <p>The priest is rambling on. If I've kept up with the order of service, this
      must be the bit where he's praying for good things for her soul in its next
      life. Myself, I always thought you get one life, and you've got to &#8212; I plan
      to &#8212; live that one to the full. But now, with back-ups &#8212; well &#8212; I'm no longer
      the me of yesterday, not yet the me of tomorrow, so if it's not me personally
      there then, I won't really notice the difference in each here and now. I'll
      live each life to the full.</p>

    <p>I must get another engram back up taken before I return to duty. Someone &#8212;
      some me &#8212; has to remember today. Even where it hurts. I've already backed up
      the bad parts. Two of her, each dying at the other's hand. That some last
      flickers of life remained was enough to drive me on. If there had been none,
      if they had been more efficient, more competent, more brutal, I wonder if I
      might not have simply given her a Viking send-off in the pyre of Egawa, and
      performed suttee into the bargain.</p>

    <p>A crazy mad flight. Days like a raw wound, like a brand.</p>

    <p>I think I treated the staff at base hospital worse this time than when I
      was a patient there, until I was sure that they were doing all they possibly
      could for her.</p>

    <p>It's getting to the &#8220;Earth to Earth, the cycle continues&#8221; bit. The little
      digger mech is starting to move.</p>

    <p>She looks so serene, as if she were sleeping, the white brocade looking
      like a wedding dress. Even though I know she's well on the mend in her
      hospital bed, truly asleep, waiting for me, I feel my eyes filling. I tell
      myself that I'm in control, calm and dignified, but I can't help my face
      screwing up, hot tears leaking slowly down my cheeks.</p>

    <p>This is the one I've laughed with, gotten drunk with, chased guys with,
      had rows with, worked with, studied with &#8212; though, honestly, she did most of
      the studying &#8212; and never held close to me as I want to hold her now. At least
      they were able to get her engram, even if they couldn't save her body.</p>

    <p>That was the first thing they did &#8212; tissue for cloning they could take at
      somewhat more leisure &#8212; take a backup from both of them. It came as a
      surprise that only one of the results was playable. When it was clear she was
      out of danger, but still comatose, they were able to reconcile her memories
      and stabilise her mental balance. The back-up problem certainly caused a
      stir, and they've gotten a lot of people involved, working on fixing that, up
      to and including the CC itself. But for the moment, she's write-only. If the
      worst comes to pass, she'll lose everything since New Eysenck.</p>

    <p>And if that happens, I'll find the bastards who did it and kill them. And
      then take their back ups and do it again. Actually, I plan to do that anyway.
      It's just not quite so urgent just at the moment. Not while she's still to
      get well again, will need me there, even if she doesn't know it.</p>

    <p>The mech is firming the soil down now, ready to roll out the turf and
      plant flowers.</p>

    <p>Everyone else is wandering off. There's a buffet in a pavilion. An
      acceptable reason to move people along, remind them that life goes on for the
      living. The Chief is talking to the grieving relatives, expressing his
      condolences, while Mme. Beryl is accepting the wishes for a swift recovery,
      and I'm standing here, leaning on an old fashioned walking stick, and my leg
      is killing me where it's still in its cast.</p>

    <p>As I stand here alone by her grave, I can hear a sound in the distance
      like surf against a cliff. Beyond the security perimeter, the sound of the
      riot, as mourners, distraught fans &#8212; off-world as well as local &#8212; are
      clashing with those who would rather be burying both of us today, backups and
      all. Closer, but keeping their distance, the press pack, reporters talking to
      their audiences, with camera drones hovering around them. The handful
      actually at the graveside are only the ones who were obliged to come.</p>

    <p>I wipe my eyes with my sleeve, and snuffle.</p>

    <p>Now the priest is out of the way, and my eyes are no longer blurring, I
      can see the stone her parents had chosen for her. A formal portrait &#8212; I think
      it was one of the ones they insisted she had done when we graduated &#8212; and
      some sentimental words. I know she'll hate it when she sees it.</p>

    <p>I take the exercise that I know I should &#8212; necessary upkeep on the most
      gorgeous legs in the galaxy. It's not the physical discomfort of new-healed
      muscle that holds me back. It's the fact that I don't know what to say &#8212; if
      any of her family actually do speak to me. Even though I saved her life, they
      will look at that headstone, and say different, the child they raised is
      dead, and that it was my fault.</p>

    <p>The buffet looks great, and well over-catered for such a small group of
      mourners. Normally, with free food on offer, I'd be scarfing it up &#8212; but
      today I have no appetite. Sheer habit drives me to take a plate, put a few
      things on it. There's nothing stronger on offer to drink than warm sake by
      the thimble, so I'm spared the decision of whether I'm finally going to go
      and get stinking drunk now, as opposed to later.</p>

    <p>I keep my distance from the others. I don't know what would be worse &#8212;
      getting into a brawl if any of her family says anything to push me over the
      edge, or wrecking my bad-ass reputation by bawling in public, on UG-wide live
      hyperwave news. There's something screaming inside me to be let out, but I
      grit my teeth. She would not believe the amount of self-control I'm having to
      use today. I think of her, and breathe again &#8212; a gasp for breath, not a sob
      or a howl.</p>

    <p>I look up from the plate I'm holding, and see her father and the Chief
      talking together. They must have been talking about me &#8212; their glances
      suddenly turn in my direction &#8212; the Chief showing a strange expression that
      it takes me a moment to recognize as concern, rather than his usual worry;
      and her father showing startled incomprehension &#8212; does he find it surprising
      that I could be as broken up as I am? &#8212; that her life is not just a family
      matter, and hasn't been for years, since we first met each other? When they
      see I'm looking up, they hastily look away again, embarrassed. What had been
      said? Does the Chief know, suspect, the thing I haven't even told
      <em>her</em>. Did he tell her father that he thinks, knows, I love his
      daughter? Or is it just that I'm looking such a mess today that they can see
      I'm in anguish, simply at the death of a close colleague?
    </p>

    <p>If she were here, she'd have a mirror so I could see what a state I'm in.
      I don't &#8212; that's not my sort of thing.</p>

    <p>That nearly sets me off again, as I remember that she is &#8212; was &#8212; here. I
      want out of here. If I could, I'd hobble out of here, right now, take the
      elevator back up the World Tree, and fly back to her side this instant. But
      this trip, I'm strictly a passenger. Something about public profile after
      Egawa &#8212; and concern about having the <cite>Lovely Angel</cite> in orbit
      around a world with only domed cities, especially with one of us piloting.</p>

    <p>I think they can read that need on my face. There's some encrypted chatter
      between the Chief and Mme. Beryl &#8212; they've both been deskbound so long that
      at times I forget that they still have their field-agent upgrades maintained
      &#8212; and they start to make their excuses. A glance, a nod, a tilt of the head
      are clear enough to say that we're moving out, the Chief in the lead as we
      head past the family.</p>

    <p>As I turn to go, something happens that surprises me. Her father catches
      my attention. I'm about to bite his head off, when he bows to me and says
      &#8220;Thank you for saving our daughter's life.&#8221;</p>

    <p>I'm taken aback, don't know if I can have heard this right. I really
      wonder what the Chief must have said to make this man swallow his years of
      dislike. But I know what I must do.</p>

    <p>I return his bow, grope wildly for the right words to say. I don't know if
      there even is a word for what it was. It was like breathing &#8212; something you
      have to do, and do without really thinking about it &#8212; when you do it because
      you gotta do what you gotta do. It wasn't even as if this was the first time.
      Just the first time I hadn't been completely successful. I open my mouth to
      speak.</p>

    <p>&#8220;That's what I'm here for.&#8221; are the words that come out. Because they are
      true, though they only scratch the surface of the truth.</p>

    <p>The moment is over; the walls come up again. We look away from each other.
      I feel relieved that I didn't blurt out the secret, nor descend to the &#8220;Aw,
      shucks, just doin' my job.&#8221; clich&eacute;. And shaken, both by the surprise of the
      gesture, and at the fierce choking rush that grabs at my throat when I tried
      to think how I would put my true feelings into words. That I would fight the
      whole friggin' universe to protect <em>my</em> little flower.</p>

    <p>Just the press pack to deal with now, and the car is in sight just past
      where they are waiting. They are moving forwards now, with the cameras
      swarming. I don't have my gun, otherwise I'd clear the skies of these
      vultures.</p>

    <p>&#8220;What about the rumour that you've only buried a clone?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;&#8212; that there's a clone out there already causing another disaster?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;&#8212; that this is the first time one of them has actually <em>survived</em>
      a disaster?&#8221;</p>

    <p>The Chief meets them all with a studied &#8220;We have no comment at this time.&#8221;
      Mme. Beryl is twitching one hand in a manner that is so achingly familiar, a
      gesture that says that she would dearly love to use a BloodyCard and is
      barely managing to stop herself. I'm strongly tempted to just give them the
      finger, but then I think of my &#8212; our &#8212; fans, and give a cheesy smile, and the
      old Victory&#8211;V salute.</p>

    <p>&#8220; &#8212; that it's always a new set of clones each time, so that it's never the
      fault of the <em>current</em> release of the D&#8212;&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Say that name, pal, and you'll be eating that microphone.&#8221;</p>

    <p>I know I'm too much of a state, looking too much of a hag, right now, to
      do my usual glare of death at twenty paces, but the message is understood.</p>

    <p>&#8220; &#8212; of the Lovely Angels?&#8221;</p>

    <p>I don't know where in the UG we'll be able to carry out our work after
      this. Maybe it is the end of the line for the Lovely Angels. Maybe we'll even
      the get the month off that we joked about so long ago. The CC hasn't said
      anything, no one's been sniffing around to measure me up for a desk job. It's
      been completely quiet while we rest up and recover. I have this ridiculous
      notion of sweeping her off her feet, taking her away somewhere and living
      happily ever after &#8212; even though the thought of settling down creeps me out,
      even though we have shared flats ever since we first met.</p>

    <p>But when we are together, I know I won't be able to find the words to tell
      her, will be too scared to let actions take their place. Even if I thought
      she'd understand.</p>

    <p>I'll probably choke up, keep my distance, try not to blub, and just give
      her a prettified version of what has happened today, say &#8220;care about&#8221; or
      &#8220;like&#8221; rather than anything more dangerous, rather than tell her the truly
      important thing, in case she runs from me.</p>

    <p>There is one faint hope, though. For all her bluster, even when completely
      out of her tree, she couldn't bring herself to pull the trigger or even just
      leave me to burn. What does she think about, about me, when lying awake in
      the dead of the night?</p>

    <p>At last, we are at the car. I sink into one of the deeply upholstered
      seats, a sigh escaping my lips, glad to take the weight off my leg. One day,
      one day, my beloved, when you are able to remember it forever, I will open my
      heart to you. Until then I will always be there by your side. Soon I will be
      back where I belong.</p>

    <p>The car starts to move.</p>

    <p>Soon, I think, so soon.</p>
