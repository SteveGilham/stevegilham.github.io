    <h1>KING BLEYS CHARITABLE FOUNDATION</h1>
  </div>

  <div id="upperblaze" class="blueblazes">&nbsp;</div>
  <div id="content">

    <h2>CHAIR: Princess Royal Caitlin of Amber</h2>

    <h2>SENIOR EXECUTIVE STAFF</h2>

    <h2>CHIEF EXECUTIVE: Janna van Rijn</h2>

    <p>Janna is a scion of a well-known Amber merchant house, chosen by
      the princess for her common sense and keen business acumen. She has
      experience of managing a large organisation from running her
      family's business and is in sympathy with the princess's aim of
      making the foundation a support for worthy causes and projects
      thoughout Amber, the new kingdoms and, eventually, Chaos. As a
      trader, she has well-developed diplomatic skills, as well as the
      ability to detect a scam. Janna is of medium height, slightly
      plump, with mouse-brown hair, rosy cheeks and shrewd but merry blue
      eyes.</p>

    <h2>DIRECTOR OF FINANCE: Thoth (Mrr)</h2>

    <p>Thoth is a handsome red Abyssinian Mrr, found for the Foundation
      by Shen and Davies. He is well-qualified to manage the Foundation's
      finances, having spent some time in the Nuevo Sangre Ministry of
      Finance (after which, anything else is a doddle). Like most
      Abyssinians he is very independent and not prone to make friends.
      His integrity, however, is beyond question.</p>

    <h2>DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS - AMBER: Selina Weaver</h2>

    <p>Selina was chosen by the princess for her extensive contacts
      throughout Amber, the original reasons for which are uncertain. Now
      convinced of its good intentions, Selina is fiercely loyal to the
      Foundation and determined both to achieve as much as possible for
      Amber from the Foundation and to ensure that the Foundation gets
      what it pays for. Selina is dark, slender and volatile.</p>

    <h2>DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS - NEW KINGDOMS: Meryck DuBois</h2>

    <p>Meryck is a former ship's captain who has voyaged to and traded
      with most of the new kingdoms at some time or another. This brought
      him to the attention of the princess when she was looking for
      someone who could be trusted to work with all the kingdoms without
      favouritism. He is a bluff, weatherbeaten man in his early
      fifties.</p>

    <h2>DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS - THELBANE: to be appointed</h2>

    <p>This post is vacant due to the unsettled situation in Thelbane
      and its associated kingdoms. The princess deals with war relief for
      the area herself.</p>
