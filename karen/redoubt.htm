    <p>"Sleep is for the dead, cutes," Nicolo says softly. "We've got
      work to do."</p>

    <p>"Oh really. What work would that be?" Cat asks suspiciously,
      trying to pull away.</p>

    <p>He just smiles and winks at Cat. She feels a wave
      of..something..washing over her. As it does, she is aware that
      something..someone..is soothing her mind, making her more
      agreeable. Cat fights it as best she can but feels as if something
      is forcing it's way into her mind, a calm, patient and reasonable
      presence that reduces her desire to fight to nil. She finds herself
      standing still, swaying slightly from side to side. Cat stops
      trying to fight the presence and concentrates on keeping a corner
      of her awareness for her own, so that she will retain the knowledge
      of what happens even if she is told to forget. She has no problem
      doing this and has the strangest feeling that it was designed to
      work that way.</p>

    <p>Nicolo appraises his work and hops up, all signs of his tears
      gone.</p>

    <p>"There. Isn't that better. Now, let's leave the right
      fingerprints here before we run off.."</p>

    <p>Nicolo seems to concentrate for a second or two, and Cat gets
      the clear and present sense of a Logrus connection being formed.
      The room is transformed, slowly, before your eyes, as if a veil
      were being drawn across it. Cat shivers. She does not feel
      comfortable with Logrus at the best of times and this is definitely
      not the best of times. Nicolo notes her shiver, but says nothing.
      The room is filled with the signs of conflict and a battle. Blood
      appears on the walls, splattered and smeared, and torn articles of
      Cat's and Nicolo's clothing lay scattered. On the floor she sees a
      playing card with the Queen of Diamonds on one side, and the
      standard of two crossed sabres with the other.</p>

    <p>"This should keep them guessing for a while," Nicolo mutters,
      rubbing the back of his neck. From where Cat stands she can see the
      edges of the wound closing.</p>

    <p>"OK. Let's go, babe. We got an appointment to keep."</p>

    <p>He takes your hand and concentrates on a Trump. Cat notices that
      the Trump is an image of a massive keep, the sky above it traced
      with racing clouds of crimson and sable. As she examines it with
      Nicolo, she hears him mutter, "Come on.. come on.." A few seconds
      pass.. Then the clouds begin to take shape.. Then she sees them
      moving.. And she finds herself standing on the ramparts of the
      keep, looking out on a flat, blasted plain of low scrub. The air
      smells of ozone</p>

    <p>Standing nearby is the figure of a man, back to her, leaning
      forward on a section of curtain wall. He looks out over the plain,
      the skirts of his red robe flapping in the slow breeze.</p>

    <p>Nicolo shakes his hand suddenly, dropping the Trump which burns
      as it falls to the ground, vanishing in a small cloud of flaming
      ash. "Jesus, you didn't have to make it self-destruct like that,
      did you," he growls.</p>

    <p>"Do not take the Lord's name in vain, Nicolo Borgia," says the
      man in a calm, modulated voice. He turns, and Cat sees that it is
      Paolo. A gold cross is slung around his neck and tucked between the
      third and fourth buttons on the front of his robe. Underneath she
      sees the hint of chainmail, and his hands are gauntleted. Other
      than that he seems relaxed.</p>

    <p>"Welcome to the Esqueline Redoubt, Cat," Paolo says, bowing
      slightly. "Your presence here is most..essential. Come, let us go
      inside and await our other guests."</p>

    <p>"If it is so essential, why could you not just ask for it? Or
      was the playacting all Nicolo's idea?" she asks acidly.</p>

    <p>With a sober look, he fingers his cross absently. "No, Nicolo
      was working under orders. But he has always chosen a certain
      particular..style..in carrying out orders, you see."</p>

    <p>"Hey, don't bitch at me, padron," Nicolo growls. "You give me a
      job, I do it."</p>

    <p>Ignoring Nicolo, he continues. "I am afraid that I was not
      confident of your response, and could not risk your disagreement. I
      am sure that when all is done, you will understand my motivations
      for your involvement in this..delicate affair, and the value of
      your being kept unawares until the time was right.
      Your..impartiality..is of the utmost importance."</p>

    <p>Cat raises a quizzical eyebrow. "Kidnapping me is supposed to
      keep me impartial, is it? I'm not sure I follow your logic, Don
      Paolo." There is the slightest hesitation before she speaks the
      title which shows she has deliberately not used an ecclesiastical
      one.</p>

    <p>"That is well..princess." There is the slightest hesitation
      before he speaks the title as well. "Look, listen, and learn. You
      will have choices to make."</p>

    <p>"And to refuse to choose is in itself a choice, which means I
      have no choice but to do as you say or be lost before I begin," she
      notes ironically. "Bravo, Don Paolo."</p>

    <p>He bows, slightly, and presses his hand to his chest. "We all
      make choices. Rarely do we have the luxury of anticipating them so
      clearly."</p>

    <p>"So I am privileged, then," she says drily.</p>

    <p>"In many ways, some yet unknown."</p>

    <p>Nicolo takes you by arm, not terribly gently, and leads you
      forward. The two of you follow Paolo.</p>

    <p>"Oh, for heaven's sake, stop manhandling me. Where the hell do
      you think I'm going to run to?" she asks irritably.</p>

    <p>Nicolo chuckles darkly, but does not release his hold. "I always
      thought you were a cute one..too bad I don't go in for the sort of
      cousin-grabbing that old dead Andy did.."</p>

    <p>"For which I am devoutly grateful, I assure you," she flashes
      back tartly. "It may be your one redeeming feature."</p>

    <p>"Aww..don't be that way toots. It's not as if you'd even have to
      do anything.."</p>

    <p>"Nicolo, that will be enough," calls Paolo from ahead of you.
      "She is a guest. You will treat her with respect."</p>

    <p>"Sure, sure." Nicolo lets your arm go, and raises his hands in a
      gesture of placation. "Don't blame me when that geas of yours fails
      and she takes a dive."</p>

    <p>He falls in step behind you, and Paolo stops and looks back.
      "Come, walk with me, young Cat. I anticipate the potency of the
      geas to diminish by the time we have entered the Redoubt proper.
      You must be of clear mind and clearer resolve by then."</p>

    <p>Cat quickens her pace to catch up with Paolo. "You speak in
      riddles, Don Paolo, as if you have some sort of test for me. Is
      that so?"</p>

    <p>"A test..perhaps you might consider it a test. You
      are..different, princess. That difference qualifies you for unique
      responsibilities. I merely wish to learn if you are ready for
      them." Paolo looks up at the sky as he walks with you. "This is a
      most beautiful place. It is ironic that such beauty will be the
      backdrop for a prison..but perhaps that will be the most bitter
      irony of all, si?"</p>

    <p>Cat looks around her. "I am not sure that everyone would agree
      with you as to the beauty of the place. Certainly it seems desolate
      enough for a prison. I do not suppose you are going to enlighten me
      as to whom you intend to imprison here." She keeps her tone
      neutral.</p>

    <p>"Everything in its time, princess. Everything. But you should
      look beyond appearances, to see the heart of things, of people.
      That which seems most obvious is often the least telling.."</p>

    <p>Using Pattern sight, Cat realizes that this place is incredibly
      charged with Pattern energy, as if the essence of many Pattern-ley
      lines converge here from places where the Patterns live..Parys,
      Amber, and beyond. Yet all the lines seem to converge in an ordered
      manner, as if they have been ordered by a separate hand to act in
      accordance with some plan. The vision is both lovely, and
      startling. Cat stops dead for a few moments, absorbing the nature
      of the place and trying to understand how it has been achieved.
      "Fascinating," she murmurs.</p>

    <p>Looking more carefully she realizes that this is a Pattern
      intersection point, where the energy vectors of Pattern meet..much
      like the Keep of the Four Worlds, this is a place of potent power.
      The subtle changes that have been made are evident to her through
      her enhanced Pattern vision. Like water, flowing visibly, emitting
      cold and heat, yet shielded through a piping that transmits effect,
      while preventing access to the source. Like bars of iron that
      combine to produce an effect.</p>

    <p>"Aahh..so you see. Very good," says Paolo softly. "I have
      ordered this place.. this.. intersection.. to serve its role. It is
      the amber that will hold an Amberite.." He pauses. "..if you so
      order."</p>

    <p>Cat looks at him, her face showing shock. "You plan to make me a
      judge?" she asks bluntly. "Why? There are already others who claim
      that title."</p>

    <p>"We are what we are. Titles..as you have made apparent to me..do
      not make the man, or woman. It is our inner selves that gives us
      form, and decides our proper function. You are..uniquely
      qualified."</p>

    <p>They proceed into the keep, and down many stairs and turns.
      Through sealed doors, through tall corridors of sweating rock and
      puddles of moisture, she finds herself ushered into a small salon.
      In it are four chairs. Nicolo leaves with one last lingering look,
      and shuts the door behind Cat and Paolo. Without appearing exactly
      at ease, Cat is clearly less uncomfortable once Nicolo has
      departed. So is Paolo.</p>

    <p>His tone changes as he speaks. "Bene. Now, princess, would you
      care to refresh yourself? It may be a little time before our other
      guests arrive, and there is no reason why you should not make
      yourself comfortable. Some chianti, si? Mangiama, if you like. I
      prepared the polenta myself, earlier today. Details are important
      to me," he says, pouring himself some wine.</p>

    <p>Cat permits herself a brief smile. "Chianti, certainly. And
      since you have gone to the trouble of preparing a meal, far be it
      from me to be so churlish as to refuse it."</p>

    <p>"That pleases me, princess. Truly, I do not wish to make an
      enemy of you...I hope that you will appreciate the merit of my
      actions when our other guests arrive. You will be protected, of
      course, and absolved of your role. In fact, the means of your
      delivery here is more for your protection than your
      detriment.."</p>

    <p>"So that I cannot be thought to have been complicit in your
      plan, do you mean?"</p>

    <p>"Correct. Nicolo brings many assets to the table, but one of
      them is not the power of subterfuge. His obvious seizure of you
      works to your advantage."</p>

    <p>"I doubt that he intended to do me a good turn, however," she
      remarks acidly.</p>

    <p>Paolo swirls his glass of wine as he holds her eyes, then looks
      down briefly as he takes a slight sip. "Nicolo lacks..refinement.
      It is an unfortunate trait of the Borgias."</p>

    <p>The meal is excellent, and Paolo makes a point to serve Cat
      first. But it is entirely contained in the room; no servants or
      others enter to disturb them. Across a glass of wine, Paolo says
      after a while, "Princess, we have had few occasions to discuss
      matters of import to us both. Is there some..insight..I could give
      you on affairs that you would find helpful? You have my complete
      and full attention, as you can see.."</p>

    <p>Cat swirls the wine in her glass gently, watching the ruby
      sparkle in its depths for a short while before looking up. "You
      spoke earlier of my being 'uniquely qualified' for the role you
      plan for me? Could you explain that, please?"</p>

    <p>"Certainly. You are the leader of the KBCF. You are the daughter
      of one of Amber's greatest diplomats. You are free from partisan
      wranglings in such affairs as Parys, Rolandae, Thelbane, and the
      current court in Amber. You have a reputation for honesty,
      forthrightness, and do not fashion yourself an ingenue. And you and
      I have never, ever been connected or associated in any way known or
      suggested. That alone may be the most significant asset you have,
      for my influence is more pervasive than has been suggested, making
      one unaffected by it singularly valid in the role that has been
      prepared."</p>

    <p>"I have always tried to keep out of family politics, certainly,"
      she says thoughtfully. "Though I am not sure how successful I have
      been, especially recently."</p>

    <p>Paolo laughs, a wry sound. "Amberites may avoid politics with as
      much success as the bird may avoid the skies. Eventually, all
      nestlings fly."</p>

    <p>"Are you about to push me out of the nest, then?" she asks
      quizzically.</p>

    <p>"Are you prepared to fly?" he replies.</p>

    <p>Cat considers for a moment. "I don't know," she says
      frankly.</p>

    <p>"Then we shall find out, will we not. The time to fly has been
      long in coming, and is long overdue."</p>

    <p>"Especially if she's talking to you, Don Paolo," says Mordred,
      suddenly appearing in the doorway. " No offense, Father, but if
      you're going to kidnap my lover, at least drop me a note."</p>

    <p>Cat looks up in surprise at Mordred's sudden arrival. She smiles
      at him, her face showing both pleasure and anxiety, before looking
      worriedly at Paolo. Mordred smiles back, with a similar mixture of
      emotions. He mouths the words "I love you" to her and then glances
      back at Paolo. She glows with pleasure at this and mouths back
      "love you, too", before composing herself and turning her attention
      back to Paolo.</p>

    <p>Paolo makes a bit of a face. "I have no desire to know any more
      of your..relationship..than I already do, Mordred. But I am glad
      that you elected to come. It was, Princess," he says, turning to
      Cat and pouring her another portion of wine, "another sign of my
      good faith to you that I allowed your..friend..to come. Do
      understand.. he will not be a party to what will happen here, which
      has risks associated with it."</p>

    <p>"Which are for me to take, because you think I am best equipped.
      Yes, I understand that," Cat replies steadily. She looks at
      Mordred. "I believe that Don Paolo does not mean me harm," she
      says, adding "Nevertheless, I'm glad you came. I think I may
      welcome the moral support."</p>

    <p>Mordred says, "Insomuch as I am a moral creature, I shall
      provide it."</p>

    <p>A giggle escapes her, but is quickly stifled.</p>

    <p>Lifting his glass, Paolo lifts his head as he gazes
      dispassionately at Mordred. "Ora pro nobis deus vivum," he calls
      out in a steady voice. There is a thrum of energy in the room, as
      if a wave of energy passed through it. (Cat notices that the nature
      of the Pattern energy has shifted relative to the view she had
      before). "There," Paolo says, standing and drawing another chair to
      the table. "The feits are restored. Now we have but to wait for our
      last two guests. Mordred, I had prepared a meal sufficient for
      five. Refresh yourself, if you wish. You see that I intend the
      princess no harm. Following your meal, I would ask that you leave.
      For your safety."</p>

    <p>Mordred sits down. "And what would be providing this danger,
      Father? Yourself? An external force? Too much wine?"</p>

    <p>Cat waits interestedly for Paolo's reply.</p>

    <p>Paolo looks into his wine. "There is really only one sort of
      danger worth worry. That of family. Especially.. close family."</p>

    <p>Cat makes a wry grimace of assent. As he says this.. The door
      opens, and there is the creaking sound of two sets of
      rust-encrusted armor moving into the room. The figures are unarmed,
      and pause at the threshold, scanning the room.</p>

    <p>"If you wished to leave, Mordred, do so now," whispers Paolo in
      an urgent tone, not taking his eyes from the door. "It will be your
      last chance."</p>

    <p>Cat looks at Mordred, fear for his safety and desire for his
      support equally clearly written on her face. For a moment she seems
      about to speak, then she turns her attention back to the figures at
      the door, leaving the decision to go or stay to him.</p>

    <p>Mordred does not look impressed. "I shall leave only if Cat
      desires it. I promise I will not... interfere with anything that
      goes on, so long as Cat agrees to it beforehand." Cat flashes him a
      grateful smile and gives his hand a swift squeeze before turning
      the whole of her attention to the figures.</p>

    <p>"..ISN'T THAT JUST THE BIGGEST LOAD OF CRAP YOU'VE EVER HEARD.."
      crackles a processed-sounding voice from the armoured creature on
      the left. With this they both enter the room. The door shuts behind
      them. They reach up and press their hands to the sides of their
      helmets, and rotate some flange slightly. With a hiss, they lift
      their helmets.</p>

    <p>"Hi, son," says Eric with a smile.</p>

    <p>Caine just winks at Cat. "And a hello to the lovely lady."</p>

    <p>She inclines her head to them. "Uncle Caine, Uncle Eric."</p>

    <p>Paolo draws a packet of cigarettes from a fold in his sleeves
      and begins to tap out one. "Don't mind if I do.." says Eric,
      reaching out his hand. "That damned helmet smells like naptha."
      After a slight pause, Paolo holds out the packet, and Eric manages
      to extract one from it with his armoured hand. He presses the end
      to his chest, and it begins to smoulder. "These things really do
      kick off some BTUs..gimme a minute to shut it down," mumbles Eric
      through his cigarette. Caine, meanwhile, has been extracting
      himself from his armor to the side.</p>

    <p>Mordred just watches. He pulls a cigar from inside his coat,
      lights it with a mirrored Zippo from the same source, and shakes
      his head. "Interesting," is all he says. Not taking her eyes from
      Caine and Eric, Cat holds out an imperative hand to Paolo for a
      cigarette. When she has it, she leans back so Mordred can give her
      a light. She inhales deeply, blows a leisurely stream of smoke and
      then says. "So, now we are all here, Don Paolo, you can tell me
      what all this is about."</p>

    <p>"Of course."</p>

    <p>Caine finally takes off the last of his armor; Eric manages to
      untangle himself, then as he kicks away the pitted breastplate, he
      pulls a small glass orb from a pouch and holds it lightly in his
      palm. Caine leans against the door, his arms folded. Cat continues
      to watch the three of them, smoking silently, waiting for Paolo's
      promised answer. She looks, if not exactly relaxed, reasonably
      tranquil.</p>

    <p>"Nicely done, kid. Nicely," grunts Eric brusquely, the cigarette
      in his lips, twitching up and down with his words. "Thanks for
      setting this up."</p>

    <p>"Not at all," replies Paolo, slowly. "But I should answer the
      princesses' question. What this is about..is your trial, father. I
      intend to see judgement passed on you, now, and the sentence
      carried out."</p>

    <p>Eric says nothing, then begins to laugh.</p>

    <p>"No kidding," says Caine, inspecting his fingernails. "Sorry,
      Eric. I made a deal."</p>

    <p>Cat gives him a sharp look, eyes narrowed, then turns her
      attention back to Eric and Paolo.</p>

    <p>Still laughing, Eric sits down, and pours himself a portion of
      wine, letting the liquid spill over the rim of his glass as he
      pours. "And who will judge me..these.. children?"</p>

    <p>Cat tenses a little, as if she knows, or guesses, what is
      coming. Paolo taps off an ash, and holds up the burning end before
      his eyes, inspecting it. "The princess will judge you."</p>

    <p>Cat lets out the breath she had not realised she was holding.
      "So my task is stated clearly at last. If I am to judge, who will
      present the cases for the prosecution and defence?"</p>

    <p>She draws again on her cigarette as she waits for an answer.
      "There is no prosecution or defense. You are the daughter of the
      King. A late King, but empowered in my eyes by virtue of your birth
      and character.. and by my association with your father..to
      judge."</p>

    <p>She bows her head, accepting his assessment. She looks at Eric
      for any signs of dissent. Eric burps, and looks at the glass of
      wine. "Same crappy old I-talian reds, Paolo. Your taste is truly
      broken."</p>

    <p>Ignoring his remark, Paolo continues. "For you see, this will
      end it. Only those in this room will know of how the result was
      reached. If you find Eric innocent..he can leave. If you find him
      guilty..he will stay. At your call, all is resolved. You are..and
      have always been..a separate party, unencumbered by these events.
      In arranging for this..meeting..I complete my oath. To bring Eric
      to justice."</p>

    <p>"Ah, yes. But your oath spoke of two people you held responsible
      for those crimes. Only one of them is here. What of the lady
      Dara?"</p>

    <p>Mordred leans forward at this point, cigar in mouth</p>

    <p>"One at a time, princess. I will deal with her..separately."</p>

    <p>"Good luck, kid," drawls Eric, leaning back in his seat and
      crossing his legs before him. "She's more than you can handle even
      on your best day."</p>

    <p>Mordred nods. "If only my follow-through were better..." Cat
      gives him a wry, worried look</p>

    <p>"Come on, kid," grunts Caine. "Up or down. I gotta go pick up
      someone up." Paolo shoots a look of cold venom at Caine. "You
      understood the conditions, Caine. Be still."</p>

    <p>He turns to Cat and nods to her. "The time has come to fly."</p>

    <p>"Indeed. And you have chosen a lofty nest to push me out of,"
      she retorts drily. Only a slight tremor in the smoke rising from
      her cigarette shows that her hands are trembling. As if noticing
      this she takes another drag at it, then puts it in an ashtray.
      Mordred puts his hand on her shoulder and nods at her. Eric just
      lounges in his chair, puffing away. Cat looks at him
      dispassionately for a few moments. When she speaks her tone is more
      conversational than judicial.</p>

    <p>"There is no doubt that you have been guilty of many crimes
      against Creation. I have spent enough time myself trying to
      mitigate the worst consequences of your actions to know that.
      Therefore I must find you guilty. But.." and here she turns to
      Paolo "others of the family have been guilty of similar crimes. I
      therefore return to you the question of whether it is just to
      imprison one man alone for crimes which have been committed by
      many."</p>

    <p>"Your question is accepted, and in that justice does not rest,
      those will be judged as well. But for today..we are resolved."</p>

    <p>Mordred looks at Paolo. "Mark me as interested in those...
      others, Paolo. Because Cat's concern mirrors my own."</p>

    <p>Eric looks around, a little smile on his lips. "Well, that was a
      hoot." He continues to sip his wine.</p>

    <p>She leans back in her chair and picks up her cigarette again.
      "You have my verdict. The rest is up to you." Mordred takes his
      hand off Cat's shoulder and nods.</p>

    <p>"That will do," nods Paolo, standing. The door opens. Caine is
      first out the door; he seems to be in a hurry. Paolo invites
      Mordred and Cat to rise. "We have a train to meet."</p>

    <p>Eric just sits, sipping his wine, then leans forward and picks
      at the polenta with his fingers, selecting a morsel to pop into his
      mouth. He does not stop Cat or Mordred. Mordred raises an eyebrow
      and extends his hand for Cat to take. His expression is such that
      it isn't easy to tell if it's for his comfort or for hers. She
      stubs out her cigarette and rises, taking his hand.</p>

    <p>As they leave the room, they hear Eric's voice, "I hope this
      makes you happy," he says, his tone somewhat subdued. Then he
      chuckles, darkly. Cat turns her head as she steps out of the door.
      "For the record, no," she says quietly.</p>

    <p>With a long sigh Paolo shuts the door behind him. "Come. There
      is not much time." They make their way back up through the keep,
      which now seems strangely empty and silent. Cat walks close to
      Mordred as they return through the keep, clearly gaining comfort
      from his presence.</p>

    <p>Ultimately they enter a courtyard, which exits onto what appears
      to be a train platform, except there are no tracks, and no sign of
      a train. Caine is standing there, inspecting an antique watch with
      an agitated look. "You'd better have gotten this right," he
      mutters.</p>

    <p>As if on cue, the air fills with a rush of fragrant steam, then
      a pulse of heat, then the piercing sound of a whistle. Through the
      clearing mists, they see a single locomotive, a single car, and a
      bright red caboose before you. On the locomotive is blazoned
      BRANDENBURG in bold capital red letters.</p>

    <p>"Of course," Mordred is heard to mutter.</p>

    <p>Caine tries first one door, than another, than a third. All are
      locked. Then a fourth door, which opens. He dashes in.. ..then
      emerges, supporting a frail, wizened lady, wrapped in a black veil,
      wearing a shapeless black dress. He pulls her away from the train;
      the locomotive gives one great whistle, then in another blast of
      steam, it vanishes.</p>

    <p>Cat and Mordred note that the woman is busy kissing Caine's
      face, holding it between her two hands. "Ooohhh..my boy, mi
      familia, gratzi, gratzi..how I have wished to see you..my
      boy..ohhh.." He holds her close, but carefully, as if he were
      worried that he would break her.</p>

    <p>Paolo, pausing, approaches the two from the side. She sees him.
      There is a pause. Then she extends her shaking hand and slowly
      draws him into the embrace with her son. "Lady, I have done what I
      said I would do," you hear him say, softly. Then the three do not
      speak, but merely stand there.</p>

    <p>Mordred shoots Cat a quizzical expression. A whisper: "I hope
      this makes more sense to you than it does to me..."</p>

    <p>"Caine's deal, I think," she whispers back. "That must be
      Rilga." She sighs. "Which may open another can of worms. Later for
      that. Let's get out of here." Mordred's expression tightens at the
      word "Rilga", but he nods</p>

    <p>Cat raises her voice and speaks to Paolo. "Don Paolo, I have
      served your purpose as you demanded. Are we now dismissed?" Paolo
      detaches himself from Rilga and Caine, and approaches the two of
      them. As he walks towards them, an archway of light opens to their
      right, rising up out of the ground. Pattern vision shows that it is
      a trumpgate, straight into the heart of Amber - in fact, to the
      Pattern Room in the basement of the Castle, to the very center.</p>

    <p>"You have served, princess. And you..prince," he says with a
      look to Mordred. "If you wish to go, I have opened a way for you.
      If you wish to stay..you have my welcome. But be aware that
      this..place..this Redoubt..will serve two purposes when we leave.
      It will keep it's occupant from leaving, but it will keep outsiders
      from entering with equal efficacy. It is a fortress that stands
      sentinel over..nothing. A fitting place for Eric's exile. In one
      hour the feits will coalesce into their final, inviolate state;
      departure after that will be impossible."</p>

    <p>"I was planning on going with the Princess, Father Paolo," says
      Mordred. "No warnings or threats needed. Though I appreciate the
      heads-up on the nature of this place. Perhaps, sometime, you'll
      tell me how you did it."</p>

    <p>Paolo smiles a little smile. "You are most welcome. I have long
      worked to your benefit, Mordred Osricson, and see no reason to stop
      now. Perhaps some day we shall discuss this place..but that may
      have to wait until it is no longer of use."</p>

    <p>"I understand," says Mordred. "Please let me know when your
      next...trial... is to occur."</p>

    <p>Rilga holds Caine at arms length; you see that she has a Rosary
      in her left hand. "Take me home," she says, looking over at the
      three of you. "Take me from this place."</p>

    <p>"OK, Mom." Caine leads Rilga towards the gate. At the very edge
      of the gate, Rilga turns and looks back at Paolo. "Gratzi," she
      says, softly.</p>

    <p>Paolo raises his hand and makes a small crossing gesture. "Go
      with God," he replies. They step through and disappear.</p>

    <p>"Our turn now, I think," Cat says. She looks at Paolo with wary
      respect. "I am not sure that I wish to thank you, exactly, but
      these events have certainly been.. instructive."</p>

    <p>"Betimes we know not why we fly, yet we do nonetheless. You have
      dared, and in daring, have won a victory. I thank you, princess,
      and am in your debt," he says, with some meaning.</p>

    <p>Still holding Mordred's hand she turns to step through the
      gate.</p>

    <p class="center" style="font-style: italic;">Exeunt, Fiat Lux, Amen.</p>
