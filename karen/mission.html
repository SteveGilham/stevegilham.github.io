    <h1>OFFICIAL STATEMENT</h1>
    <p>It has come to my notice that doubts have been expressed in some
      quarters as to the bona fides of the KBCF. The Foundation was
      originally conceived as a charity to promote education and the
      arts. It was always intended that its remit should extend beyond
      Amber to all the new and related kingdoms, and even to
      Thelbane.</p>

    <p>However, given the widespread displacement and loss suffered by
      innocent people of all descriptions as a consequence of the
      Thelbane civil war, there was a clear need for the Foundation to
      change its policy to address these more immediate issues. The
      Foundation has therefore been reconstituted as a disaster relief
      charity. It will continue to function as such as long as the need
      remains. Its services are available to meet the need for disaster
      relief for any and all peoples, whatever the cause of the
      disaster.</p>

    <p>The Foundation will not intervene where agreements for access to
      refugees and the safety of its personnel cannot be guaranteed, nor
      where a distinction cannot be drawn between military and civilian
      personnel. Within those limitations, it will go wherever it is
      needed without fear or favour. As long as the princes and
      princesses of Amber and Thelbane choose to spread their quarrels
      indiscriminately across the worlds innocent peoples will continue
      to suffer. The Foundation exists to mitigate that suffering as far
      as possible.</p>

    <p>I pledge myself to ensure that the Foundation maintains strict
      neutrality in its activities. I call on all the princes and
      princesses of Amber and Thelbane to recognise the Foundation as a
      neutral body and support its work, even if only by allowing access
      to areas under their control.</p>

    <p>Caitlin, Princess Royal of Amber</p>
