    <p>The empty Shadow is just that. They are standing in a dark and
      apparently barren place, though the quality of sound as Mordred
      gives quiet, swift orders to his forces suggests that this is
      somewhere subterranean. Forces arranged, Chesceni sets up his
      barrier. Mordred and Cat clasp hands briefly with each of those
      present, then move away.</p>

    <p>They stand facing each other, a couple of paces apart. Both go
      sky-clad. Mordred holds Excalibur unsheathed in his right hand. Cat
      has her oakwood staff in her left hand and the Jewel hangs by its
      chain from her right hand. Cat begins to sing, making complex
      gestures with the hand holding the Jewel. As she does so, a rope of
      red and green light begins to form about her. A few moments later,
      she passes the Jewel to Mordred, who begins his own song,
      generating his own rope of light, this one white and blue. Cat and
      Mordred move closer together, still singing independently, until
      they stand shoulder to shoulder, hands clasped together over the
      Jewel. Mordred strikes with Excalibur, blood flows into the
      sacrificial vessel, and the songs become one with a joyful cry of
      'we are joined!' in the Melodian tongue.</p>

    <p>The ropes of light, momentarily drowned in blood red. regain
      their own hues, now inextricably linked together. Cat and Mordred,
      still singing, move into an intricate dance that is more than half
      a moving meditation. As they continue, the braids of light follow
      them, becoming more brilliant and more complex as the creation
      dance continues, until Cat and Mordred are completely obscured by
      the three dimensional network of light that they are creating. For
      those watching and listening it is possible to tell that sometimes
      one song, sometimes the other takes the lead while at other times
      the two are totally blended in a single anthem.</p>

    <p>Eventually the anthem reaches its final chord and Mordred and
      Cat reappear, walking out of the maze at the point where they began
      it, hands still clasped together on the Jewel. Mordred still bears
      Excalibur and Cat her staff, but now they are garbed in elaborate
      silken robes, embroidered with the motifs of dragon and phoenix.
      Behind them, the maze of coloured light hangs in the air. They turn
      to look at it. Cat is first to break the silence. "Mandala," she
      says simply.</p>
