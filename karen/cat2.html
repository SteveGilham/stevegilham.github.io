    <h1>Walking the Pattern again</h1>

    <p>I'd felt the itch in the back of my mind ever since I arrived in
      Amber. Nothing really identifiable, just an awareness of the
      presence of the Pattern that was always with me. I'd been carefully
      ignoring it for the most part, not feeling ready for another
      encounter like the one in Rebma. Then came the day they brought the
      King's body home. I was in the city when the procession arrived. I
      wasn't prepared for the outpouring of genuine grief among the
      populace - I don't think anybody was. I lost track of how many
      soothing and healing spells I cast and, when those ran out, how
      many hugs I gave.</p>

    <p>When I finally returned to the castle, all I really wanted was
      someone to hug me. In the absence of anyone I felt like being
      hugged by I settled for a glass of wine. This was a mistake. I had
      relaxed in a chair and let my mind drift away from the trauma of
      the day. Before I consciously realised it, I found myself halfway
      down the stairs to the Pattern room. Jasra's insistence that the
      Pattern should be open access to Family members meant that I would
      not be challenged if I chose to go on down. I paused to consider.
      While I hardly felt at my best, the niggling itch was growing
      rapidly into a conviction that I needed to take the Pattern again,
      that I would need the additional powers such a walk could give me.
      I squared ny shoulders and carried on downwards. In Rebma, Morgaine
      had transported us directly to the Pattern room, so I hadn't had to
      make that walk before. It felt very long.</p>

    <p>When I eventually pushed open the heavy door into the Pattern
      room I almost expected to hear the Pattern say "there you are at
      last", so strong had the sense of urgency grown. But of course the
      damn thing just sat there and flickered at me. I stood there for a
      while just looking at it. It is, in its own way, extraordinarily
      beautiful - all whorls of cold fire in the darkness, with just the
      occasional spark running along them to remind you that it's alive
      and dangerous.</p>

    <p>I walked slowly round to the starting point, still half
      expecting some remark from the Pattern. Silence. I hesitated before
      putting my foot on the line. Once you start there is no going back
      and the Pattern is known for its tendency to play head games. I
      shrugged and stepped forward. If I hadn't intended to walk the
      Pattern, I wouldn't have come down all those stairs. The familiar
      tingling began as I moved onto the first curve.</p>

    <p>I'd made it through the First Veil before the images began.
      Faces, mainly, few of whom I recognised although somehow I knew
      that they were all family, but not the same ones I had seen last
      time. I wondered briefly what this might signify, then dismissed it
      as I concentrated on the next Veil. Following this, there were
      images of my father and a strong impression that he would soon be
      in Amber. Along with that came the realisation that this could
      potentially be dangerous for me. As I moved slowly towards the
      Grand Curve, I wondered how I might protect myself. The certainty
      grew that what I was doing here was an integral part of such
      protection, though I could not yet see how.</p>

    <p>I was beginning to tire by the time I hit the Final Veil and it
      was every bit as hard as it had been the first time around.
      Eventually I found myself meditating on the whole of the Pattern,
      holding it in my mind as I tried to push forward. When I did this,
      the Veil parted so suddenly I lost my balance and found myself on
      my hands and knees at the Pattern's centre. Now I understood. I had
      engraved the Pattern's image in my mind and could call it up
      whenever I wanted. I could use its powers without having to walk it
      physically.</p>

    <p>Thinking this and realising I was ravenous after my exertions, I
      decided to test it out. I got the Pattern to send me back to the
      dining room, where I snagged another glass of wine and some bread
      and cheese. Then I called the Pattern to mind and transported
      myself back to my room. I don't think I've ever enjoyed a meal more
      or slept better.</p>
