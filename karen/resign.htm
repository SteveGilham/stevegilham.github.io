    <h1>Cat's Resignation from the Parys Cabinet</h1>

  <div id="content">
    <p>To Merlin, Prince Regent of Parys</p>

    <p>Herewith my resignation from your cabinet. I can no longer
      continue to tacitly support your rule when you offer so little hope
      or succour to your people. In the time I have been in Parys you
      have done nothing to aid in the rebuilding of the realm nor have
      you made use of the considerable resources you command for anything
      other than your own selfish purposes. I will not work for someone
      who shows himself so unworthy of respect.</p>

    <p>I came to Parys because you said you needed my help. It seems
      that the reason you sought it was simply to spare yourself any
      effort to alleviate the suffering of your people. That they are
      suffering is undeniable and I do not intend to desert them in their
      need. I plan to remain in Parys and continue with my work but as
      the head of a non-governmental organisation, not a government
      department.</p>

    <p>Caitlin of Amber</p>
