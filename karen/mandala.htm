    <p>It starts with a single note, and a mote of light. Warm,
      golden-red light, like sunlight filtered through autumn leaves. The
      note continues, dancing up and down the scale, and the mote
      gradually becomes a slender stream. Then it is joined by a second
      note and another mote of light, this one white, as cool and
      brilliant as sunshine on snow. The second note plays its own tune
      and the white light too forms a slender stream.</p>

    <p>Another note joins the first tune in simple harmony and a green
      light appears, a warm green with hints of brown, like the depths of
      a forest pool. It swiftly forms its own stream, flowing ever closer
      to the red as their song grows more complex. Then the two streams
      touch, braiding together into a single rope of red and green light.
      Their song has the soothing warmth of a lullaby.</p>

    <p>Now it is the turn of the white light to gain a complement to
      swell its song. This one is blue, as deep and clear as the depths
      of a lake on a sunny day. It and the white light sing notes of
      welcome as they hasten to entwine. When the blue and white streams
      meet, the resulting tune has the intricacy and precision of a chess
      game. They flow toward each other; red and green, blue and white,
      each singing gently. When they touch, there is for a moment another
      red, the brightness of fresh blood. Then the two songs join in a
      single strong chord. Those familiar with the musical tongue of
      Melodia may recognise the joyful cry "We are joined!" as the true
      dance begins.</p>

    <p>Two skeins of music, two ropes of light, that dance together in
      the darkness, now touching, now apart, yet always together and
      moving towards the same end. A long dance, twisting, complex, yet
      always with its own internal logic and sense of harmony. Sometimes
      the cooler tones dominate and then the music has a more martial
      tone. At others the red and green skein sings songs of warmth and
      healing. Then the two combine and sing together of the joys of work
      well done and life and love shared before each picking up their own
      theme once again.</p>

    <p>So the song goes on, and the ropes weave their ever more complex
      spiral until at last they join for a final time, twisting together
      into a thick coil as the song reaches its final harmonious chord
      and the end returns to its beginning. There it hangs in the
      darkness. A gently spinning three-dimensional maze of braided,
      coloured light, with no clear start or finish point. A Mandala,
      indeed.</p>
