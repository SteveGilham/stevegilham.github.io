    <h2>(as told to her Mrrr companion, Shen Kuei, after her return to
      Haven palace)</h2>

    <p>I never thought I'd realise the dream so easily. When Morgaine
      said she could take me to walk Rebma's Pattern there and then I
      almost didn't believe it. There was no way I was going to pass up
      the chance to do what I'd been wanting even before I knew what it
      was I dreamed of. I took Morgaine's hand and we were there.</p>

    <p>The Pattern - I'd dreamed of its whorls of cold fire before I
      ever knew what they were. The reality was beyond those dreams. It
      took me a few moments to register Morgaine asking if I wanted any
      witnesses to my walk. I wished that you could have been there but
      you'd have hated being wet. I'm not sure why I suggested Kelric,
      except that I felt he had a right to be there if he wanted. I
      hardly waited for him to arrive before I started.</p>

    <p>From the first step I knew this was what I had been born to do
      and must do, not least because to fail would mean my death. I took
      another step and felt the current run through me, making me one
      with the Pattern. I approached the First Veil, concentrating on
      moving steadily. Images filled my mind; riding in green hills and
      sailing the lakes of Killarney when I was still young enough to
      think life was simple; newspaper headlines from the same time which
      made a mockery of those childhood certainties. I struggled with the
      Veil and finally it parted. I moved on, feeling the waters stirred
      by my passage. More images filled my mind, this time of faces. Some
      of them I had seen in Haven, others I did not recognise, but I knew
      they were all relatives. The Pattern was playing guessing games,
      trying to distract me with surmises as to which of them might be my
      true parents. I gritted my teeth and kept on, concentrating on the
      line of fire ahead. The Second Veil began to make its presence
      felt, bringing with it images of my surrogate parents and the
      bitter arguments there had been over my determination to dance. I
      felt almost sorry for them now; they could not have known quite
      what a cuckoo they were raising. What chance had they of imposing
      their will on a child of Amber?</p>

    <p>Quite suddenly I was through the Second Veil as I thought of
      what it means to be a child of Amber. I understood then that my
      exceptional good health and unusual strength are all part of that
      heritage and that I would need them in full to finish what I had
      started here. I drew on the disciplines I had learned from Tai Ch'i
      and settled in to the long haul of the filigree and the Grand
      Curve, banishing conscious thought beyond what was needed to take
      the next step.</p>

    <p>After what seemd like an eternity I felt the resistance ease.
      The vistas of Shadow opened before me and I knew that I had the
      power to walk them and eternity to explore them should I so desire.
      All I had to do was take the last few steps, but then I hit the
      Final Veil. Corwin described it as like trying to push through a
      concrete wall and he was right. It seemed as if Time stood still as
      I struggled to take that final step. I reminded myself that
      dripping water can wear away stone and kept pushing. Finally the
      barrier parted and I was through. I had succeeeded in claiming my
      heritage. Elation banished some of my exhaustion and I turned to
      wave to Morgaine and Kelric.</p>

    <p>To my surprise, Kelric in wolf form was walking the Pattern
      towards me while Morgaine was talking to Max, who was busy taking
      photos. Kelric joined me at the centre - he's a real pussycat in
      wolf form, by the way - and we posed for more photos. Max walked
      the Pattern too. He and Kelric seemed to find it much easier than I
      had.</p>

    <p>We had all rejoined Morgaine and were preparing to leave when
      things turned scary. The Pattern spoke to us! It seems it didn't
      care for Kelric's attitude, which was rather cavalier, I must
      admit, and wanted the four of us to walk it together in some kind
      of ritual to increase its power relative to the other Powers. Well,
      we didn't really have much option but to agree. So there we were,
      Morgaine leading with the Jewel of Judgment which the Pattern had
      summoned from somewhere, Kelric, Max, and me last to close the
      line. Kelric persisted in treating the whole thing as some sort of
      joke - he even summoned up a disco to play the conga to accompany
      us until I asked him to stop.</p>

    <p>I'm not sure what the others felt, but I know I understood the
      workings of the Pattern much better that second time around. There
      were far fewer head games and the walk was easier, too. That may
      have been because the Pattern wanted us to walk it, I suppose. When
      we finished, the Pattern was definitely brighter than it had been
      and you could feel the difference in the air, or water, rather.
      Something had passed from us to the Pattern, I'm sure. I was
      suddenly shattered, and I think the others must have been as well
      because we didn't even talk about what we had just done but each
      went our own way.</p>

    <p>So that's the story, and now I'm going to sleep for at least a
      week.</p>
