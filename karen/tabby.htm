    <h1>Clan Tabby Mrrr</h1>

  </div>

  <div id="upperblaze" class="blueblazes">&nbsp;</div>
  <div id="content">

    <p>By order of their creator, Brand, the Tabby Clan is the Royal
      House of the Mrrr.Most notably, they hold the highest offices in
      the kingdoms of Brandenburg and Rolandae which Brand and his
      descendants rule. As a royal house they have the following
      characteristics.</p>

    <h2>Self-satisfied</h2>

    <p>They are very much aware of their royal status and very pleased
      with themselves because of it. This smugness leads them to adopt a
      rather high-handed approach. They have, for different reasons, a
      similar tendency to Siamese to take over any enterprise in which
      they are involved. For a Tabby, it is simply because nobody else
      could possibly do it, any of it, better. Often they are correct,
      but sometimes this attitude can backfire.</p>

    <h2>Snobbish</h2>

    <p>Tabby Mrrr disdain to serve anyone who is not descended directly
      from Brand and preferably also Swayville, leaving remoter family to
      be served by other Mrrr clans. They take a slightly pitying attitude
      to those, both Mrrr and Amberite,who do not have the advantage of
      what they consider truly royal birth. They are not always popular
      with those on the receiving end of this attitude. Their snobbery
      also tends to reinforce the tendency to regard much of the family,
      and all Shadows, as dispensable so that they encourage Brandite
      destructiveness.</p>

    <h2>Overfed</h2>

    <p>The Tabby are the gluttons of the Mrrr. They have an insatiable
      passion for food of all kinds and will eat themselves virtually
      insensible given the chance. The best way to distract a Tabby Mrrr
      from something is to feed it. Not all Tabbies are overweight,
      though, as some of them get a lot of exercise hunting and
      then supervising the preparation of their catch.</p>
