    <p>The first stage was the hardest. Not because the climbing was
      hard - there would be steeper and more dangerous ascents later -
      but because of the despoliation by man of the Himalayan slopes. All
      around were signs of erosion caused by overuse of paths, along with
      litter abandoned by the holiday climbers who now infested the
      mountains. It wasn't an auspicious start to the journey I needed to
      make. You may wonder why, in that case, I chose to start from the
      northern slopes of Earth Prime's Himalayas. The simple answer is
      that I knew my way from there and the place I sought to reach is
      not easily found. Besides, the lamasery in Tibet is the closest I
      have to a place of power on any continuum and I wanted all the help
      I could get to reach my goal. I spent some days there meditating
      and preparing myself before finally setting out.</p>

    <p>The litter and the man-made erosion were the first things I
      subtracted as I climbed, so that soon I moved alone in a silent
      world of ice, snow and rock. For a while I abandoned myself to the
      simple process of climbing, aiming simply to cover ground, making
      only minor shifts in the landscape to bring it closer to my memory
      of the place I sought. At nightfall, I knew, the stars would tell
      me whether I was getting closer to my goal. I continued like this
      for some days, across landscape which seemed unchanging but
      sleeping each night under different stars.</p>

    <p>There is a rhythm to climbing that can be both a help and a
      danger. It helps you cover ground but can lull you into missing
      early signs of treacherous terrain. I got a rude reminder of that
      as one afternoon began to draw towards twilight. I was negotiating
      a tricky wall of frozen snow when a handhold I'd thought secure
      suddenly wasn't and I took a nasty tumble. I know it was nasty
      because the next thing I knew I was lying at the bottom of the
      crevasse and it was full dark. My leg was twisted rather awkwardly
      under me. I wondered briefly if it were broken, then somehow knew
      that it wasn't. By rights it should have been, given the distance I
      must have fallen. I thought about getting up for a while, and then
      tried it. Much to my surprise everything seemed to be in working
      order. I made camp and sat and thought about the fall and its
      aftermath. I remembered plunging through the air, my body twisting
      of its own volition, trying to fly, glide, do anything to mitigate
      the coming impact. Then nothing, until I woke recovered only a few
      hours later. There was something odd about the whole business but I
      couldn't work it out. I gave up and watched the stars instead. I
      hadn't made it far that day, but that was hardly surprising under
      the circumstances. I could soon make up the lost ground. I settled
      to sleep, reasonably content.</p>

    <p>The next day I proceeded more circumspectly and made good
      progress. By evening I was beginning to recognise some features of
      the range I must cross to reach my goal. Preparing supper, I found
      my stores considerably lower than I'd planned for. Reflecting, I
      realised that I had eaten a full two days supplies at supper after
      my fall. That finally served to trigger the memory I'd been trying
      to chase down. One of the family describing the feelings associated
      with shape-shifting and the hunger that results from its use. He'd
      said, too, that the ability was often first triggered in a
      life-threatening situation.</p>

    <p>That thought set me back on my heels a bit. I'd known, in an
      abstract sort of way, that my Thelbane heritage through my mother
      meant that I had the potential to be a shape-shifter, but I'd never
      even thought about trying to develop it. Now it seemed that I could
      indeed shape-shift, and had cause to be grateful for the ability.
      At any rate, that hypothesis fitted the facts so far and could be
      tested simply enough. I smiled to myself. If I were indeed a
      shape-shifter it could prove useful. To be able to appear as
      someone different at times, especially as long as people didn't
      know I could do it, would be a very useful Talent. In the meantime,
      there was the question of supplies. I was still several days out
      from my destination and my supplies would run out before I reached
      it. I would have to hunt.</p>

    <p>With careful management I was in the range I sought and
      beginning to descend below the snowline by the time my supplies ran
      out. As I was checking my snares for small game towards twilight, I
      heard the low grumble of a big cat, not too far away. The next
      moment she came into sight, a snow leopard, visible against the
      rock only because she was moving. It seemed likely that she had
      been attracted by the brace of hares my traps had caught. I watched
      her for a while, admiring the sleek economy of her movement and the
      idea came to me that this was a chance to test my hypothesis. I
      called the leopard, projecting thoughts of friendship and food. Her
      head came up and she looked at me, uncertain but unafraid. This was
      wild country, without two-legged hunters. I summoned again,
      swinging a hare so that she might catch the scent of it.</p>

    <p>That brought her. She covered the ground and took the hare in
      one swift movement. My friendship spelling held enough that she did
      not bother to depart with her prey but settled to eat where she
      was, ignoring me. If I were going to test this new ability, now was
      the time. I touched the head of the leopard gently, opening my mind
      to hers, learning her instincts and the way her body worked. Then I
      shrugged out of my insulated clothes, willing my body to
      change.</p>

    <p>I'd have done better to wait. I hadn't thought about what it
      would mean to the leopard to be suddenly confronted with a rival
      while she was feeding. She yowled and caught me a swift clout round
      the head, warning me away from her meal. I rolled over, yowling
      myself in protest, only half aware for the moment of who or what I
      was. Fortunately, my roll took me close to the other hare and the
      scent of the meat distracted my animal form. I carried the hare to
      a safe distance and fed, somewhat clumsily, using the understanding
      I'd gained from the leopard of how to use this strange form. By the
      time I'd finished, the other was long gone. With hunger sated and
      the potential rival departed my self-awareness returned. I held the
      leopard shape for a while longer, practising moving and climbing
      until I could do it without thinking, then changed back, dressing
      quickly in the chill dark. I slept late and woke hungry, but well
      content with my night's work. As I continued my journey, I also
      continued to practise taking leopard form until it became almost
      second nature.</p>

    <p>Another two days and I was beginning to descend into the valley
      proper, reaching the uppermost of the terraced fields where the
      millet crop waved. Ahead and below I could see the roofs of the
      temple complex with their complicated patterns of heavy red tiles,
      still more than a days march away. A brief spell sufficed to alter
      my Earth Prime cold weather gear to the heavy felt and hide more
      common here but I made no other change. My face was known and ,
      besides, I had no reason to hide. That night I slept in a village
      as guest of the local headman, a courtesy traditionally extended to
      pilgrims on their way to the temple. I repaid the courtesy, equally
      traditionally, by leaving with them everything save my staff and
      the clothes I stood up in. Then I turned my face to the temple.</p>

    <p>My feelings as I walked the road to the temple were ambivalent.
      This was a place I knew well and had used before as a sanctuary for
      reflection, but this time I had set myself a more demanding goal. I
      was not sure whether I feared the answers I might find or that no
      answer might be forthcoming. It was almost night by the time I
      entered the temple gates, footsore and with a heavy heart. I paid
      my respects to the abbot, a quiet, kindly man who blessed me and
      led me to the baths himself. I had forgotten how much a hot bath
      and a meal can lift the spirits. By the time I settled to sleep I
      felt much more hopeful of a favourable outcome.</p>

    <p>The next day I began my meditation. Sitting below the statue of
      the mahatma, I sought to clear my mind and disentangle what it was
      I wanted from this visit. I would not leave the shrine again until
      I had either found my answer or knew that there would be none. For
      a long time I seemed to get nowhere. Concerns about the Family
      wrangles and KBCF matters filled my mind and gave me no peace.
      Sitting has never been my favoured form of meditation, and
      eventually I abandoned it and began a sequence of t'ai chi chu'an
      to give myself a rest. Once I began the sequence of moves my body
      knew so well, my thoughts began to flow more clearly. I realised
      that I could not put all those things out of my mind because they
      were the reason I was here. I wanted a way to respond to them, to
      influence Creation for the better. The flaw in the KBCF was that it
      was reactive, seeking only to repair the damage done by Family
      squabbles. It was time to find a way to be pro-active.</p>

    <p>So now I had my question. However I had still to find an answer.
      I continued the cycle of moves and let my mind clear, repeating the
      sequence as I considered the way forward. It didn't really take
      long to come to the view that I needed a power base, but what form
      should it take? It would have to be carefully designed to prevent
      it from being suborned by other family members. There was the rub.
      I had not studied powers or sorcery in anything like the depth that
      others of the family had, so how could I hope to keep my base
      secure? It almost seemed that I had worked out what I needed to do
      only to discover that I could not achieve it. I sat down again to
      try and think of a way forward.</p>

    <p>The answer came simply enough. I could not hope to match my
      elders or my siblings in mastery of their powers, so I would have
      to make my own. I knew it could be done - I had felt it done twice.
      If Aria and Ches could create their own powers, then I should be
      able to create one that would be uniquely attuned to me; a realm
      that I could protect properly from other family members. I looked
      up at the smiling face of the mahatma and could have sworn it
      winked. "What did your father tell you, kid?" asked a voice in my
      head. "'Do things your own way', wasn't it? 'Bout time you figured
      out how." Not a voice I recognised, but family, I was sure.</p>

    <p>There's not much more to tell. The rest of the time at the
      temple was spent on practicalities, working out what I needed to
      know and do before I could go ahead. Since then, I've been working
      on those things, making decisions about how Mandala will work, what
      it can do, how to have it be the refuge I want it to be and still
      keep it safe, all that sort of stuff. I'm nearly there now, so I
      guess the question is do you want to be part of this?</p>
