    <p>Burmese are the individualists of the Mrr and therefore hardest
      to categorise. They do have some common features, however, which
      can broadly be described as follows:</p>

    <h2>Confidence</h2>

    <p>Burmese *know* that they are superior in looks, intelligence,
      breeding and anything else you care to mention. For this reason
      they rarely bother to maintain their dignity. They behave like
      kittens or alley cats as the mood takes them, a trait which often
      leads others, especially other Mrr, to brand them as clowns and
      underestimate them accordingly. They are not above posing as
      ordinary dumb cats, especially when pursuing something which has
      piqued their curiosity (see below).</p>

    <h2>Serenity</h2>

    <p>Burmese are contemplative, preferring meditation to action. They
      also tend to be lazy. They are often wanderers, walking by
      themselves. When they do choose to become involved in human
      affairs, it is usually as companion or advisor to a single person.
      Power for its own sake tends not to interest them. Where they do
      involve themselves, they are loyal companions, prepared to take
      risks for their friends.</p>

    <h2>Curiosity</h2>

    <p>This, if anything, is the Burmese overriding trait. All Burmese
      are intensely curious. Piquing their curiosity is the best way to
      persaude them to do anything and they may involve themselves in
      complex machinations "just to see what will happen". Of course,
      they will not let others know that this is what motivates them
      because that would spoil the experiment.</p>
