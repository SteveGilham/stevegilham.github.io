                        <p>Character: Caitlin (She prefers to be called Cat, however.)<br /></p>

                        <p>Cat was part of the Equinox Amber PBEM; in that game, the Courts of Chaos were referred to by
                                the
                                name Thelbane (much as Amber is the name of the Courts of Order).</p>


                        <h2>Description</h2>

                        <p>Cat is small (5'3") and compact. She has the muscle tone and
                                grace of the athlete and dancer she is. Her wavy hair is the
                                red-brown of autumn beech leaves and her eyes are hazel-green. She
                                wears her hair long, usually in a plait which hangs to her waist.
                                Her favoured style of dress is easy, fluid designs which allow
                                freedom of movement and her colours are turquoise and sea-green
                                (all shades from sunlit to storm-dark).</p>

                        <p>She is usually accompanied by a handsome brown Burmese cat named
                                <a href="shenkuei.jpg">Shen Kuei</a>.
                        </p>

                        <p>Here is her trump [&copy; Janet Vialls, 1996] -
                                the scanning (showing up places where reworking affected the
                                surface texture) and compression have not done the original
                                justice. Cat is leaning on a thick oak staff significantly taller than
                                she is. It is beautifully carved with a running garland of oak
                                leaves and acorns. She is looking out of the picture, smiling
                                quizzically, with the practise mirror and barre in her apartment
                                behind her and Shen curled on a cushion near her feet. She is
                                wearing deep sea-green silk karate pyjamas over a paler leotard.
                                Her feet are bare and her heavy plait of red-brown hair hangs over
                                her shoulder.
                        </p>

                                        detail</a> from another trump [&copy; Angela Taylor, 1996]. Here the decor,
                                rather than Cat herself, shows her
                                colours.

                        <h3 xml:lang="fr">Pied &agrave; terre</h3>

                        <p>Cat's Paris flat is on the first floor of an old building in a
                                back street near the Luxembourg gardens. It has a moderately sized
                                living room, lined with bookshelves carrying a mix of books, found
                                objects and plants. One wall has a mirror and dancer's practice
                                barre. The floor is wood for the same reason and the furniture is
                                mainly bean-bags, cushions and rugs which can easily be cleared
                                away when Cat wants to practice. Besides Cat, like her namesake,
                                prefers to sprawl.</p>

                        <p>There is a small kitchen/diner behind the living room, not very
                                often used as Cat tends to eat at the local bar. The bedroom is
                                next to the living room and roughly the same size. It is dominated
                                by a huge antique iron bedstead and another bookcase.The bathroom,
                                also small, is behind the bedroom. The living room has a balcony
                                which is full of plants, with just room for a chair, usually
                                occupied by Shen in fine weather.</p>

                        <p>The rooms are sunny, with white walls and the soft furnishings
                                reflect Cat's favoured colours, creating an undersea sort of
                                effect.</p>
