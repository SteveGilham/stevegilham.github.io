    <h1>Clan Siamese Mrrr</h1>

  <div id="content">

    <p>Siamese view themselves as natural aristocrats. For this reason
      they tend to gravitate to power and therefore to be found as
      courtiers or high ranking officials. In these roles they display the
      following characteristics.</p>

    <h2>Tyrannical</h2>

    <p>This trait is displayed equally to their subordinates and those
      they nominally work for. It manifests largely as an insistence on
      knowing exactly what is going on at all times and a pathological
      refusal to delegate authority. While refusing to delegate, they also
      tend to assume authority beyond their nominal position, often by
      highly devious means. Unless closely supervised and curbed a
      Siamese Mrr will rapidly take sole control of any enterprise in
      which he is involved. Unsurprisingly, this means they are not
      popular as bosses or colleagues, though lazy or disinterested family
      members find them very useful. It has to be said, though, that they
      are very effective ministers, which often leads those employing them
      to overlook this fault.</p>

    <h2>Pompous</h2>

    <p>Siamese Mrr are very keen on appearances and therefore always on
      their dignity. A Siamese Mrr who thinks he has not been accorded the
      respect he is due is adangerous creature indeed. Dare to laugh at a
      Siamese Mrr and you will make an enemy for life. This can be
      problematic as their insistence on standing on ceremony often makes
      them appear faintly ridiculous.</p>

    <h2>Greedy</h2>

    <p>Siamese Mrr think they are entitled to the best of everything
      and are determined to make sure that they get it, and the more of it
      the better. In terms of food this usually means quality rather than
      quantity - they leave gorging to the Tabbies - but they have a
      particular passion for titles, money and anything rare and precious.
      The best way to get a Siamese Mrr on your side is to bring him a
      valuable present and lay on the flattery with a trowel. This needs
      to be finely judged, though, as Siamese Mrr are far from
      stupid.</p>
