    <p>I got into the hobby from SPI games and thus reading about this
      <cite>D&amp;D</cite> thing in the SimPubs UK 'zine in the spring of '76,
      which was during my first undergraduate year. It then took me six months,
      finding only a random copy of either <cite>Greyhawk</cite> or
      <cite>Blackmoor</cite> in one of the general games shops in Soho, before I
      tracked a copy down, and a group of gamers who were using a highly variant
      home-brew set of systems. Taking it home at the Yuletide holidays that year,
      I plunged immediately into DMing (mainly for the crowd at my old school), and
      system tinkering.
    </p>

    <p>I would probably have drifted out of the hobby in a couple of years, as my
      brother did, but for meeting Karen. Shortly after we had gotten together, she
      told me about this wonderful game one of her friends had been playing, and
      wondered did I know about it. I said that I did and advised she probably
      didn't want to. But she wasn't deterred.</p>

    <p>That became the classic 78/9 highly variant dungeon crawling game that
      really (mis-)informs my opinions of (original, pre-Basic, pre-Advanced)
      <cite>D&amp;D</cite>. That in turn drove me to stop tinkering and start DMing
      again myself, on a regular basis this time.
    </p>

    <p>This early period while still in and around Cambridge was marked by a lot
      of variously successful home-brew FRP systems, many unrecognisable as
      derivatives from <cite>D&amp;D</cite>, as well as some &#8220;roll a d20 and see
      what it looks like&#8221; super-hero games (finding <cite>Superhero 2044</cite>
      unusable as it stood). There were attempts at <cite>C&amp;S</cite>,
      <cite>DragonQuest</cite> and <cite>TFT</cite> which came to naught, and a
      little variant <cite>RQ</cite>. Burnout with fantasy by the early '80s, and
      moving away for work, led to playing a bit of <cite>Trav</cite> that got
      nowhere, and then <cite>Champions</cite>, the latter turning into an open
      campaign where everyone who had something to run GMd, until the flaws (bricks
      rule, energy projectors suck) were too blatant to ignore. One off (and never
      again) sessions in this time also included <cite>Call of Cthulhu</cite> and
      <cite>Paranoia</cite>.
    </p>

    <p>Returning to Cambridge in the late 80s, gaming mainly alternated between
      myself and one other GM (who has now gone on to run the <a href="http://www.quantal.demon.co.uk/saga/index.html"
        title="Set in Brittany, at La Roche Carib&eacute;e"><span xml:lang="la">Saxum Caribetum</span>
        <cite>Ars Magica</cite> Saga</a>), with <cite>AD&amp;D2</cite> being the
      default system, but also <cite>RQ</cite>2.8/Glorantha (later
      <cite>Pendragon</cite> 3rd edition), <cite>Shadowrun</cite> (1st &amp; 2nd),
      <cite>V:tM</cite> (2nd), and <cite>Ars Magica</cite>(3rd), with a little bit
      of <cite>Trav</cite>, <cite>MegaTrav</cite>, and <cite>Star Wars</cite> (2nd)
      (this last being used as a generic RPG) on the side.
    </p>

    <h2>Gaming keynotes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>in 1984, while preparing for a &#8220;everyone bring a couple of favourite
        characters&#8221; gaming weekend, while others were exercised narrowing down to
        a couple of characters from a vast portfolio, my problem was coming up
        with characters to shortlist. I could now call upon the many
        <cite>Champions</cite> PCs I later designed - but it established that I
        was already more the GM than the player
      </li>
      <li>my first character of any consequence (as opposed to first that lasted
        to gain levels at all) was an elementalist mage from the 78/9 game,
        almost the only mage I've ever played. The later PCs have tended to be
        simple &#8220;walk up to other people and hit them a lot&#8221; types, perhaps with a
        little magic on the side (e.g. RQ characters or AD&amp;D2 priests).</li>
      <li>the all-comers <cite>Champions</cite> aside, I've not run or played in
        a long running &#8220;signature&#8221; campaign. Too many one-shots that folded
        ignominiously, and campaign longevity meaning lasting 6 months.</li>
      <li>In 1995 I went through a serious bit of burnout, and that's why I'm
        only in 2003, so many years later, actually getting round to scanning and
        uploading all this stuff.</li>
      <li>In summer 2003, I went to the <cite>Conjuration</cite>, the biennial con at New Hall, and saw the
        demo games of <cite>HeroQuest</cite>, almost on the 25<sup>the</sup> anniversary
        of the original <cite>RuneQuest</cite> which promised it as one of the few
        detailed &#8220;To be published&#8221; sources. And it fired my enthusiasm
        enough to start to look for players &#8212; but these turned out to be thin
        on the ground, and by the time I'd managed to accumulate a possible quorum (and
        that needing to take account of players with children having to work around their
        bed-times), work was going through a &#8220;as many hours as it take&#8221; patch,
        and after that, I'd managed to get distracted by watching anime DVDs on the PC,
        and finding that other things had then arisen to take up my creative energies,
        away from dealing with flea-bitten barbarians. And so I'm in total RPG burn-out.</li>
