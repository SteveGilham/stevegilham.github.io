    <p>Does what it says on the tin. It would have been a RQ/C&amp;S hybrid, the
      latter being the source for ritualised magic. The world is a construct, a
      flat world inside a finite sky.</p>

    <h2>Character backgrounds, development, motives etc.</h2>

    <h3>Normal characters</h3>

    <p>The potential backgrounds includle</p>

    <p>Townsman (heartland) <br />
      Minor Noble (dispossessed) <br />
      Hunter/Trapper/Davy Crockett<br />
      Peasant (heartland)<br />
      Settler (with choice of useful craft)<br />
      Bandit <br />
      Ex-soldier</p>

    <p>Please invent suitable life histories to the sort of age range of 16&lt;
      18 &lt; preferred age &lt; 25 &lt;30. Older characters will be allowed, but
      will have to be tailored so as not to be too overkill, younger ones will have
      had virtually no chance at gaining any useful skill.</p>

    <p>The majority of characters will begin in the frontiers, the untamed
      temperate forests to the NE of civilisation, the heartland of which is based
      around open lands in the south, mainly in the basins of a number of rivers,
      extending as far as the southern coast of this land.</p>

    <p>Cultural background is sort-of mediaeval in the heartlands, sort-of
      American early pioneers in the forests. Men are expanding into what theology
      (see creation myth) predicts is virgin territory, but which is lousy with
      trolls and such, and possibly worse, out in the nor'east, which is the
      easiest way to expand.</p>

    <p>Technology is high mediaeval (standard FRP convention).</p>

    <p>People are generally friendly, even the nobles, who have mainly a
      cermonial importance in this culture, with their hereditary wealth and some
      privilege as partial reward for the tedium of their posts.</p>

    <p>Fighting you learn from either knockabouts &amp; some real action against
      nasties around the villages, or from trained fighters, but experience in
      combat is the easiest to come by.</p>

    <p>Other trades are taught by craftsmen, and the Low Magic spells are taught
      by either Wizards or Reapers, all of whom expect a price, more usually a
      service than cash - cash is rather rare in this culture.</p>

    <h4>Acquiring adavanced character types:</h4>

    <p>Agent of Fortune: apply to, and convince a Shaman of your worth.
      Convincing can be either cash, service or treasure. <br />
      Reaper: ditto<br />
      Shaman: ditto</p>

    <p>A Shaman is generally reclusive, communing with the spirit world in the
      wild places, however some few team up with Reapers as a quasi priest-hood,
      and such types are liable to be found in villages.</p>

    <h4>Motives of the advanced character types</h4>

    <p>Agent of Fortune: To serve the shaman who inducted you, until this is
      discharged. Then to harry the forces of the Dark. Perhaps the acquisition of
      Reaper or Shaman status will appeal.<br />
      Reaper: after initial service, many Reapers are after personal power, and
      such is accepted. They will tend to be motivated as are Agents of Fortune,
      and may indeed seek this status. Others are content for a more gentle
      lifestyle, taking the role of what in this world would be the village
      priest.<br />
      Shaman: after initial service, to gain more proficiency in the spirit world.
      This can be best accomplished by some adventuring to gair more Mcap (POW)
      They will eventually tend to settle down and pass on their skills to younger
      supplicants. They may take a priest-like role, but rarely, and such as do are
      almost invariably partnered by a Reaper,</p>

    <h4>Other comments</h4>

    <p>Reapers and Shamana take 6 months over training, in which time all DEX
      based skills decay to L=DEX if initially L&gt;DEX; and T falls to DEX/6 if it
      had exceeded this. [skill % is level L multiplied by a training factor based
      on T - the first 6 T levels five multipliers 2.5;4;5;5.8;6.5;7 in a gradually
      decreasing return on investment].</p>

    <p>After training they may regain this by experience only, and their time is
      spoken for so that they have no chance to improve T or % by practise.
      Non-physical skills may be acquired at the rate of 2 hours per day.</p>

    <p>Agents of Fortune who become Reapers merely peg at their current values,
      as the knowledge is stored in their allied spirits.</p>

    <p>Conversely Reapers who become Agents of Fortune have knowledge pegged in
      their allied spirits, and have the time gain/regain skills. For a Reaper to
      become an Agent of Fortune, the 90+% skills are not required, however the 5
      &gt;=90% conditin must be met before any &gt;100% skills can be acquired.</p>

    <h3>Wizards</h3>

    <p>They divide into two brackets, generally.</p>

    <p>The quieter suits, Earth(Pentacles) and Water(Cups) may tend to a
      philosophical-alchemical way of life. They will tend to be reclusive
      combining advancement in magic with advancement in alchemy.</p>

    <p>Such types will either be found in remote towers, or in the service of
      some noble who tolerates them for the benefits of their alchemica works. The
      more extrovert of these suits may be hermits or quiet wanderers, who may pick
      up with other reclusive types (e.e. shamans) as companionship, or with those
      who will be their apprentices.</p>

    <p>Fire and Air (Swords and Wands), however, tend to be more active. They may
      be lords, of a harsher sort than is usual, having established themselves as
      men of temporal power in their own right, though Air are less likely to take
      this extreme than Fire.</p>

    <p>Wizards will typically remain in apprenticeship until attaining level 11
      (Page), during which time they will have also run errands for their masters,
      both to procure items, and so that they might learn of the world of normal
      men. Also this gets them away when they would be nuisances.</p>

    <p>After the end of their apprenticeship they will be expected to leave, with
      a little cash/credit to forge a life for themselves, before at the rank of
      Herbit (IX) they are ready to take on the responsibility of being Master to
      others. By this time they will have usually have established their lifestyle,
      and become settled in it.</p>

    <p>Player Wizards will start at about 8th level, after about 5 years of
      apprenticeshp, half given over to their own studies. After they reach l1th,
      their choice is free, though it should be guided by the character of the
      suit, and whatever it is, it will be acceptable, unless one turns to greed
      and evil.</p>

    <p>If a wizard becomes "selfish", s/he must expect hir old master to come and
      humiliate hir, though if s/he beats hi master, this is accepted as the
      workings of fate, and he is seen to have established his right to the path he
      has chosen. Other wizards may disapprove, but will only seek to curb his
      excesses, or to swat hir if an easy chance comes up. There will be no general
      hue-and-cry.</p>

    <p>Motivation for a Wizard is firstly to find a lifestyle that can support
      him and allow him at least one month in two dedicated to study and meditation
      in a semi-permanent base. S/He feels no hurry, the road to enlightentment is
      not a rushed one. There is always the world - and is this not indeed the
      Final Trump? Whether this is as a lord, a hired servant or a wanderer, it is
      immaterial.</p>

    <p>His art demands little in the way of material goods, only his focus and
      his pack of Trumps.</p>

    <p>Wizards are DEX-limited in -skill and training as are Reapers except for
      the following:<br />
      Swords: Gain T=3 in a sword (usually their focus type) and may reach any
      Level (%&gt;100 is allowed)<br />
      Wands : Dittro with a staff <br />
      Cups : Swimming <br />
      Pentacles : Evaluate treasure<br />
      Non-weapon suits may take 2 ofher skills at T=3 and no level limit, provided
      they are in keeping with the character of the suit.</p>

    <h2>Creation myth</h2>

    <p>In the beginning was the void, and in the void were the fathers of men.
      And the fathers of men gathered substance from the void and formed the
      world.</p>

    <p>To light its darkness they set up Lamps, the sun in the south, bright and
      golden, and the silver moon in the north. The sun they set to wax and wane,
      so time might be measured in days, and the moon waxing and waning a slower
      pace, so that men might mark one day from another.</p>

    <p>And in the light of the first days, the fathers of men looked at the
      barren tands, and from out of the void brought trees and grasses, beasts of
      the fields and fish of the seas.</p>

    <p>Then in the morning of the world, the fathers of men turned inwards and of
      their own substance made man, that he might delight in the world they had
      made.</p>

    <h2>General Intro</h2>

    <p>Combat is the only systemn much as before, but</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Armour is rated by point protected, not arbitray types</li>
      <li>Levels are gained on a % chance by succcsfully doing things; each
        weapon and attack and parry are rated separately,</li>
      <li>Training exists to show how well levels become %s and to gain
        levels</li>
      <li>All rolls are %s, and the higher die is selected by
        white&gt;purple&gt;bluea... &gt;red&gt; pink&gt;black by default</li>
      <li>Rolls &lt;= % success are good</li>
      <li>Parry will block blows that would otherwise hit</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Weapon speeds in are altered as follows</p>
    <ol>
      <li>No STR factor</li>
      <li>2 :=1; 3:=2; 4:=3; 6:=4; 8=:5; 9:=6; 10:=7</li>
    </ol>

    <p>also altered are the following</p>

    <h3>Combat essentials</h3>

    <p>Attack Level = L(dex) + L(wis) - enc</p>

    <p>Parry Level = L(dex) - enc</p>

    <p>Missile Level = L(dex) - 5 * enc on arms</p>

    <p>Defence % = (L(dex)+L(wis) - enc)*5%</p>

    <p>Stealth Level = L(wis) + L(dex) - L(size)</p>

    <p>Manipulation = L(wis) + L(dex) - L'(str)</p>

    <p>Knowledge = L(wis)</p>

    <p>Perception = L(wis)</p>

    <p>Oratory = L(cha) + L'(wis)</p>

    <p>where L(stat) is (stat/4)-3 round up; L'(stat) = sign(L)*(abs(L)-1)</p>

    <p>Stats are str,dex,con,cha,wis,wpr,mcap on 3d6 with 1s read as 6s;
      size,build on 3d6 straight</p>

    <h3>Magic</h3>

    <p>There is a thing called Battlemagic that anyone can use. You can know any
      amount, have as many cost points "up-front" as your WIS and to cast them
      costs points off your current Mcap. Spells upfront are not expended in
      casting; points may be suppressed at the rate of 1 per hour, and drwn from
      deeper memeory at the same rate (so 2 hrs per point swapped).</p>

    <p>Specialist magicians exist. [Systems detailed elsewhere in lost
      documents]</p>

    <p>At Mcap &gt;=15 and when they have 5 abilities at &gt;=90% characters may
      go through a process to acquire an allied spirit or familiar, and become able
      to gain abilities to levels above 100%, and the title Agent of Fortune.</p>

    <p>At Mcap &gt;=18 and literacy more than 90% one may gain the rank of
      Reaper, and acquire a familiar and a retinue of mroe powerful spells at the
      cost of permanent expenditure of Mcap. These may be cast at will, and are
      renewed with no further cost and taking a day per point to recover.</p>

    <p>At Mcap &gt;= 18 and Cha &gt;=15 the character may become a shaman, and
      gain more power in the spirit world, including storing Mcap there, and to be
      able to raise the dead</p>

    <p>Alchemy is available for those who wish to retire from active play.</p>

    <h2>Astronomy</h2>

    <p>Observations from the Royal Observatory, accuracy 2 arcmin.</p>

    <h3>The sun</h3>

    <p>A circular disk to limit of accuracy, 57 arcmin across, yellowish white in
      colour. It stands at 12 deg 16 min over the horizon, varying about 6 arcmin
      over 100 miles north-south traverse. It falls from mag -27.2 to &gt;6.5 over
      a 2 hour period of dusk, and rises similarly at dawn. The rise is roughly
      linear in perceived brightness.</p>

    <p>The middle of the maximum brightness period happens every 24 hours. The
      daytime (flat brightness) length varies from 4 to 16 hours between midwinter
      and midsummer.</p>

    <h3>The moon</h3>

    <p>A silver-blue disk, 1 degree, 23 minutes arcoss, 18 degrees 36 minutes
      above the horizon, varying by 15 arcmin over the 100 mile traverse. It is 177
      degrees, 21 minutes clockwise of the sun, the angle varying by 74 arcmin on a
      100 mile east-west traverse.</p>

    <p>The moon varies from mag -11.9 to &gt;6.5 with the middle of the bright
      periods happening every 24 hours and 48 minutes, starting in phase with the
      day at the start of the year (midwinter), and coming back into synch every 30
      days. Bright periods last as long as the current dark of the sun. The moon is
      a featureless disk, and dims uniformly over its face, save for some slight
      central condensation when nigh extinguished.</p>

    <h3>The stars</h3>

    <p>These are pinpoints of bright light (magnitudes between -5 and +2) dotted
      over the night sky, but they are not observed during the day (they are
      visible in twilight and moonlight). Star patterns rotate around the sky once
      per year, about a pole just over 11 degrees south of zenith, and 4 degrees,
      46 arcmin clockwise of the sun.</p>

    <p>The zodiac is about 45 degrees up the sky, about 5 degrees lower in the
      south, 10 degrees higher in the north. The month/sign is that one above the
      sun.</p>
