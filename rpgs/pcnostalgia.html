    <h1>PCs from the olden days</h1>
  </div>
  <div id="upperblaze" class="emerald">&nbsp;</div>
  <div id="content">
    <p>My first PC was a fighter, in plate, wielding a 2-handed sword. These
      things called &#8220;kobolds&#8221; died a lot when he attacked them, and yielded up a
      chest full of copper coins. He survived the one delve, including cowering
      from a carrion crawler, but was never played again. The second character was
      the only fire-and-forget mage I've run. He died on the way to the dungeon,
      when a random encounter came up as displacer beasts. They don't Sleep very
      well&#8230;</p>


    <h2>Linda</h2>
    <p>The first character who went up levels was from my brother's dungeon
      (early 1977):</p>
    <p>Human Female Thief. Str 13 Int 9 Wis 11 Con 16
      Dex 16 (12Left) Cha 12 Will 8 Size 12 (5&#8242;9&#8243;) Psi 0</p>

    <p>Cash 36GP, Exp 7586 (4th level) Hits 16 (with the original D4/level HP for
      a thief), AC7 (leather).</p>

    <p>Sling, +1 sword, +1 dagger, pack, ring of regeneration, ring of
      invisibility, horse (with harness).</p>

    <p>The original character sheet (half a coding form from the local computer
      lab) also contains a hit-list of characters (run by lower VI<sup>th</sup> formers, and
      other such vermin) that had sassed her. She had a brother Leon, who was a
      bard (as per an early Strategic Review), and no discernable character
      development.</p>
    <h2>Osrica</h2>

    <p>The most significant character (and only one for whom records survive)
      from the dungeons I ran at the time (again early 1977, with vary variant
      systems already)</p>
    <p>Half-elf Female Mage Str 9 Int 16 Learning 15
      Con 15 DexR 18 DexL 10 Cha 21 Will 15 Size 10 Psi 8 Sense 15</p>

    <p>Equipment - Sword +1, locater; Flame lance (22 charges) Regeneration ring
      (1 pt/10 rounds) Invisibility ring, Bracers R10, Illusion Gloves, Personal
      wand of lightsabre x2 (enchanted item that multiplied spell points flowing
      through it).</p>

    <p>She was one of a family with similar names that my brother played (I still
      remember the regrets I felt when the oldest of them, her brother Ulric, fell
      to a carrion crawler in the Hall of Machines&#8230;)</p>
    <h2>Ororo</h2>

    <p>The highest level D&amp;D character I ever ran was almost my last ever
      spell-caster. From Martyn Wheeler's 78-9 dungeon</p>
    <p>Human female elementalist Str 12/12 Int 17 Wis 9
      Faith 13 Con 10 Immunity 13 Dex 14/15 Cha 22, Size 8 Build 9 Will 7.</p>

    <p>Elementalist +10, Generalist +4, Illusionist -3 Enchanter -7; Level 12
      (904,822xp) 140,384 GP 28 HP</p>

    <p>Staff of Wizardry (105 charges left), Rings of spell-turning, fire
      resistance, prot+1, scrolls of Improve Invisibility (x2) Forcewall (x2)
      Firestorm (x3) fly (x3)</p>

    <h3>Cat</h3>
    <p>Her familiar</p>
    <p>pseudodragon elementalist Str 7 Int 10, Wis 16,
      Faith 5 Con 15, Imm 12 Dex 24, Cha 20, size 15, Build 14, Will 31</p>

    <p>Elementalist +9, Illusionist+9; Level 11 (714,500xp) 48 HP</p>

    <p>Ring of invisibility, ring of 7 spell storing (Disintegrate, Teleport and
      a bunch of Elemental summonings)</p>

    <h3>Ororo and Cat together</h3>

    <p>This chaotic good pair chafed rather under the rigid lawful-good senior
      members of the party (she joined at first when most were at levels 4-5),
      especially the treasure division system based on xp-hours of delving less
      value of current items, and the strange ideas about what were or were not
      fair targets. Having managed to be the one to pick up this staff to try, she
      adopted a &#8220;take it off me if you think you're hard enough&#8221; approach, which
      being at least nine tenths of the law, led to acquiesnces by the lawfuls.
      Having it, she used it only <cite xml:lang="la" title="in extreme [circumstances]">in
        extremis</cite> (usually to summon
      elementals as dumb hit-points). She first took damage at about 7<sup>th</sup> level when
      a gas spore exploded; and only died once at 12<sup>th</sup> level, when a ~20<sup>th</sup> level
      enchanter lich managed to mass charm much of the party, including the fighter
      with the vorpal blade. And she rolled an 00 on her system shock roll &#8212; but
      the GM ruled that the number of hit-points her familiar had were enough to
      mean that she had never really died, and only needed the healing effect of
      the raise to re-attach her head.</p>

    <p>By the end, Ororo's role was combat air patrol (she
      is the subject of the many of the early <a href="memorable.html">memorable
        experiences catalogued
        elsewhere</a>), but with the campaign emerging from the dungeon into almost
      heroquesting, in a cross-planar (from misty moors, to fire, to ice, to the
      magic garden) expedition to a magical place of power, she finally found
      something that was a worthy goal. She would perform the quest again herself,
      to the strange garden of the Crystal Pyramid, and rather than looting the
      pyramid, perform certain rituals about the sundial that lay between the
      entrance gates (cast iron, not inter-planar portals) to gather the power to
      create her own demi-plane, a small island surrounded by the shimmering void.
      Entered from the plane of ice, it was to be a place of snow covered pine
      forest, with people of the pines all over. Some 50 miles from the entry,
      behind a maze of force walls, a valley that was a summer garden, with a
      little cottage where she could retire.</p>

    <p>But the campaign underwent a system conversion to use a different combat
      system, and the changes in relative character ability that this wrought
      crashed the campaign. At that point she was the highest level equal (behind
      the Enchanter, Fortash, who was about to break to 13<sup>th</sup>).</p>
