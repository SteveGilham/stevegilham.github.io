    <h2>Context</h2>

    <p>Greg Stafford asked an interesting and correct question over a decade ago,
      when asking about &#8220;who is the Orlanthi sun god?&#8221; &#8212; but the
      answer he got is one that caused a lot of confusion, until it was hammered
      into a compromise, such as <a href="http://www.btinternet.com/~nick_brooke/articles/elmal.htm">this summary
        by Nick Brooke</a>.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, I still think Greg's answer was wrong in its essentials.
      One god is the night watchman who stayed behind when <strong>Orlanth</strong>
      went on the LBQ &#8212; his aspects are twilight and the watch-fire. The
      reconciliation with <strong>Yelmalio</strong> is an identification of the
      twilight aspects, which presumably rejected an origin amongst the Lowfires
      that the watch-fire implies. This is the god most obviously deserving of the
      name of <strong>Elmal</strong>. His devotees are able to use some minor fire
      magic appropriate to a night watchman's role (the outline myth out of
      <cite>Storm Tribe</cite> has no Hill of Gold or other loss of Heat in his
      story, whereas that loss of such was almost the first thing we learned about
      Yelmalio in <cite>Cults of Prax</cite>; ergo my version retains a full range
      of Fire, if not any great depth), while Yelmalions are not. That aside, any
      deity around during the Great Darkness really, by definition, cannot be a sun
      god - the mythic precedent is too strong.
    </p>

    <p>At about the same time that Greg dropped his bombshell, Neil's RQ game
      almost stumbled across the what I feel is the right answer, when the PCs
      stumbled across a remote Orlanthi tribe who partook of very austere ways like
      the Solar monks of the far northern Empire of long ago. Their
      <strong>Orlanth</strong> is, I think, much more likely to be the real
      Orlanthi sun-god.
    </p>

    <p>The obvious Orlanthi Sun-God is, of course, <strong>Orlanth</strong> in
      his aspect as the successful completer of the LBQ, restorer of the Sun after
      the Great Darkness and the Gods' War, <strong>Orlanth Lightbearer</strong>,
      or <strong>Orlanth Lucifer</strong> if you rather. We can see the influence
      of <strong>Orlanth</strong> in the fact that what he restored was not the
      static Sun of the old sterile Fire Tribe Emperor, but a Sun that follows the
      Storm Spiral, around and around the world, sometimes to the north, sometimes
      to the south. <strong>Orlanth Lucifer</strong> would be the god of the Sun,
      but clearly not the Sun himself. The Orlanthi New Sun, the thing he came back
      with would be a separate entity - and <strong>Ehilm</strong> sounds the most
      plausible name for the sacred fire itself, the light of the day. Maybe &#8212; I'm
      not clear on this myself &#8212; it may even be the repentent Emperor in some
      form</p>

    <p>Meanwhile the physical manifestation that corresponds to
      <strong>Elmal</strong> is not the Sun, that orb of the daytime &#8212; no, it is
      the spark that the Buseri call <strong>Lightfore</strong>, and the Praxians,
      <strong>Sun Daughter</strong>.

    <p>To be initiated in this aspect, the candidate must have completed the

      one of the principals. As a consequence, there are few initiates; and almost
      all of them are devotees.</p>
