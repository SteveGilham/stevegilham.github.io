    <p>As anyone who's read my other <a href="index.html">RPG pages</a> &#8212; and
      especially <a href="biog.html">my background page</a> &#8212; will know, I burned
      out on gaming in early 1995 &#8212; and that I spend a lot of time on those
      pages talking about either variant <cite>D&amp;D</cite> or
      <cite>Champions</cite>, but other systems are only mentioned in passing.
    </p>

    <p>As it happens, I've had a love/hate relationship with RQ/Glorantha for
      going on 25 years now.</p>

    <p>I first encountered Glorantha in the form of the original <cite>Nomad
        Gods</cite> game at the Wargames Soc. at college, and thought it a little bit
      silly &#8212; though by no means as bad as Greg Costikyan's humour in the SPI
      <cite>Swords and Sorcery</cite> game. It was a while later, when looking to
      other systems to find bits to plunder to fix <cite>D&amp;D</cite>, that I
      picked up a copy of RQ2 (the new edition at &#163;8, as opposed to the old one at
      &#163;5, this being back in about '78). <cite>RQ2</cite> had a lot of things that
      I thought made for an ideal game &#8212; individual skill ratings rather than
      blanket levels, fixed hit-points &#8212; but it didn't have a splashy magic system
      in that way that <cite>*D&amp;D</cite> always has, so while I tried a few
      one-off sessions, and Karen even did her first bit of GMing c1980 with
      <cite>RQ</cite> set in a setting of her own, Glorantha languished as
      something I read fragments of in <cite>Cults of Prax</cite>,
      <cite>Trollpak</cite>, and <cite>Cults of Terror</cite>, but never did
      anything with.
    </p>

    <p>Neil Taylor picked up a copy of <cite>Borderlands</cite>, and started to
      run a campaign based on that set. The characters were mainly Orlanthi
      (Sartar's equivalent of the Church of England), with a neo with a death wish
      playing an Humakti. With the limited source material, we modelled Sartar
      after high classical Greece, like the pictures in the rule-book suggested,
      and the Praxians &#8212; at Horn Gate, at least &#8212; as Arabs at the stereotypical
      oasis.</p>

    <p>And at that sort of time, the group burned out on the whole fantasy genre,
      and Karen and I moved house from Cambridge to Stevenage because I needed a
      job. When we found our feet there, we started playing other games with a new
      set of players (the group that Phil Masters had accumulated), mainly
      <cite>Champions</cite>. Meanwhile <cite>HeroQuest</cite> had gone from being
      a &#8220;source to be published&#8221; in the list at the back of the <cite>RQ2</cite>
      rulebook, to an item in the Spring 1982 issue of the Chaosium Games catalogue
      in which promised it for that summer.
    </p>

    <p>Time passed. <cite>RQ3</cite> happened, and the combination of the dollar
      price hike, and the pound falling almost to parity meant that it cost 5 times
      what the previous edition did &#8212; &#163;40 in 1985 money [by comparison,
      <cite>HeroQuest</cite> is priced at about &#163;24 in 2003 money]. I did pick up
      the hideously expensive boxes of Gloranthan background (<cite>Gods
        of...</cite> , <cite>Genertela</cite>) and pored over them for arcane
      details, while the modified rules stayed on the games' shop shelves.
    </p>

    <p>By the late 80s, I was back in Cambridge and working at the same company
      as Neil Taylor. As the <cite>Champions</cite> game folded due to increasing
      dissatisfaction with the Hero System, he and I would spend hours going over
      the minutiae as revealed, especially the new scraps in a new fanzine,
      <cite>Tales of the Reaching Moon</cite>. I remember fascinating discussions
      about recherch&eacute; topics like the implications of the <cite>RQ2</cite> Prax map
      showing the burial mound of a prehistoric hero even larger that the specially
      large mountain pictogram used for Kero Fin, the mighty goddess-mountain.
    </p>

    <p>And so he set up an <cite>RQ3</cite> game based in a slightly variant
      Glorantha (the big conflict was Tarsh &#8212; oriental in flavour &#8212; vs. Sartar &#8212;
      more like the current received wisdom, though <strong>Babeester Gor</strong>
      was in the role now occupied by the <strong>Vinga</strong> cult which hadn't
      been discovered at the time, and <strong>Yelmalio</strong> was taken as the
      cult accepted as the Sun among Storm), based alternately in Pavis and Sartar.
      I had problems stumbling over bits of rules that had changed subtly since the
      previous edition; other players had problems with other bits of the system
      like the experience rolls (one Unicorn Woman had her most frequently used
      combat skills stick at ~45% while others went up to ~70% because the dice
      would hardly ever convert a skill check into a % increase). We all found that
      the restraints on spirit magic meant that the old standby of &#8220;Glue&#8221; (Healing
      6) battle-magic that made combat a survivable thing was no longer a plausible
      strategy. A belated change to <cite>Pendragon</cite>, to use the virtues and
      passions system as part of the cult attributes just made things worse &#8212; the
      movement rates and ranges meant that we had something like five times as many
      rounds to take damage from emplaced trollkin slingers when advancing from
      their extreme range to contact. [From this experience, I'm somewhat dubious
      about <cite>Pendragon</cite>'s ability to truly emulate the almost
      <cite>D&amp;D</cite>-like combats in Malory.]
    </p>

    <p>The game also suffered from the &#8220;tourist trap&#8221; tendency &#8212; with a detailed
      world, the temptation comes to play tour guide, and escort the PCs around all
      the interesting parts &#8212; so our lowly step-and-fetch PCs were sent hither and
      yon, until the game folded under cumulative dissatisfaction, and I ran some
      cathartic high level <cite>D&amp;D</cite> to permit some righteous
      ass-kicking that the <cite>RQ</cite> had denied us.</p>

    <p>With the '90s also came the <cite>RQ</cite>-revival, spearheaded by a
      group that gave the appearance of seeking to play something between
      &#8220;Morris-dancing, the RPG&#8221; and &#8220;Iron John, the RPG&#8221;, which is still present in
      <cite>Hero Wars</cite> material like <cite>Thunder Rebels</cite>. The
      Glorantha that came out of this was trapped in a Procrustean bed of
      unsatisfactory mechanics, and with revelations that changed my perception of
      the world &#8212; not essentially trivial things like the
      <strong>(Y)elmal(io)</strong> flap, but that the Sartar/Lunar conflict was a
      lot more German/Roman rather than Greek/Persian as the <cite>RQ2</cite> art
      implied. Yes, <strong>Orlanth</strong> is meant to be <strong>Tiw</strong>,
      not <strong>Zeus</strong>, and the new vanguard had only contempt for the
      stuckist grognards who liked the old way better.
    </p>

    <p>In the middle of this I burned out on gaming, and when <cite>Hero
        Wars</cite> came out, I couldn't even gather the energy to focus my eyes on
      Neil's copy. I knew I had reservations about what I heard about the system &#8212;
      important events getting handled in a quantum box, with abstract action
      points expended until the state collapses and you can tell what happened &#8212;
      like who got wounded and how much. Later on, I did buy <cite>Storm
        Tribe</cite>, another gods book, and without the damnable barbarian
      culture.</p>

    <p>But this year, <cite>HeroQuest</cite> &#8212; I did like <a
        href="http://stevegilham.blogspot.com/2003_08_01_stevegilham_archive.html#105999464479460825">what
        I saw at Conjuration</a> enough to look out <cite>Storm Tribe</cite>, if only
      to try and answer the question &#x201c;who are all these strange gods that
      the demo game PCs were devotees of?&#x201d; and then get a copy of
      <cite>HQ</cite> for my birthday. I'm still not sure about the system, the
      extended resolution in particular; and when I'm in a mood to worry about
      having too much arbitrary fiat power as GM at the totally free scope of
      attributes (like <cite>Over the Edge</cite>, but more so). The rules hacker
      in me starts to think about perhaps using something like the West End Games'
      <cite>StarWars</cite> D6 system, with a <cite>HQ</cite> keyword corresponding
      to an <cite>SW</cite> stat. But I was motivated to at least think about doing
      something.
    </p>

    <p>Having been out of the loop for a while, I found much Gregging and
      counter-Gregging had gone on, but I think that Glorantha has reached a point
      where it has completed a metamorphosis, to a new understanding and a new
      system, unlike the very awkward state in the '90s when the New True Way and
      the uninspired changes that went into <cite>RQ3</cite> mechanics tore in
      different directions. Now at last we have a mechanical exposition that
      supports, rather than thwarts the subjectivist approach.</p>

    <p>For example, back in <cite>RQ2</cite> days, there was the assumption that
      a warrior would be an Humakti, and there was the one-size-fits-all cult of
      <strong>Humakt</strong>; but in <cite>ST</cite>, <strong>Humakt</strong> is a
      seriously scary god that only dangerous weirdos follow (normal warriors would
      follow <strong>Orlanth</strong> sub-cults that no-one who hasn't been
      following Gloranthan events in detail for the last few years will have heard
      of, like <strong>Hedkoranth</strong> and <strong>Helamakt</strong>). In HQ,
      he's back to being a standard warrior god &#x2013; but only for cultures
      neighbouring Sartar. This I interpret as being because the core Orlanthi
      culture has access to all the minor attributes/associates of
      <strong>Orlanth</strong>, which squeezes the other big gods out into the
      margins. A similar process seems to have taken place with <strong>Babeester
        Gor</strong>, with the Orlanthi having <strong>Vinga</strong> in the place
      that the Earth Avenger takes in related cultures who don't also have the
      Defender Storm.
    </p>

    <p>Of course the process is not 100% &#x2013; it doesn't fix the
      <strong>(Y)elma(io)</strong> problem that really set the cat amongst the
      pigeons over a decade ago, and had been just about reconciled (provided you
      don't enquire too deeply into how the myths fitted together) &#x2013; the
      <cite>ST</cite> version of <strong>Elmal</strong> as the Orlanthi sun-god
      doesn't really hang together as a myth (it singularly ignores who it was that
      the Orlanthi think was the object of the Lightbringer quest, or the fact that
      <strong>Yelmalio</strong> is the light of the sunless sky i.e. twilight). So
      far he's swept under the carpet in <cite>HQ</cite>, in favour of
      <strong>(St.) Ehilm</strong> (a Saint in Aeolian Esvulia (formerly
      Heortland)) &#8212; and we last heard of <strong>Ehilm</strong> as a western
      figure, the sorcerer who had become too entangled in solar powers, cognate to
      <strong>Yelm</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>It is interesting to note that, having the assumption in the examples of a
      PC party made up from folk all across the continent, and with only distant
      ties to their kinfolk (occsaional calling in of favours for support in the
      play examples), the game has drawn back from the anthropological style of RPG
      that was going to have killed the setting eventually. The rigid tribal
      Sartarite society is alien to most 21<sup>st</sup> century players, more so
      than easy things like feudalism. Indeed the restrictive elements are stronger
      than some in real-world societies which are causing active harm to people in
      the UK caught between their ancestral ways imported from the Indian
      sub-continent and the ways of their peers and age-cohort.</p>

    <p>Having the God of the New Way of Things associated with the people of
      &#8220;We've always done it this way&#8221; isn't something that most people will get.</p>

    <p>One thing that hasn't changed in <cite>HW</cite>, and by adoption,
      <cite>HQ</cite>, are the rather silly monsters, which hark me back to the
      first encounter with <cite>Nomad Gods</cite>. One thing that has improved a
      bit are the scenarios. I dismissed an early famous <cite>RQ</cite> scenario
      with this summary:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The adventurers are approached by a man seeking armed assistance. He
        explains that he has bought, for resale, a sacred item. The person who he'd
        bought it from had stolen it from a small nomad tribe, killing most of the
        adults in the process. When two of the survivors demanded its return from
        the man now seeking PC assistance, he had his assistant shoot one. He has
        now found out that they intend to return in force to recover their
        property, and is seeking help to defend his house and this item. &#x2013;
        What do your characters do?</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The scenarios in <cite>HQ</cite> are better than this.</p>
