    <h2>Definitions</h2>

    <h3>Required Information</h3>

    <p>Each combatant's abilities are dependent on pre-determined characteristics
      listed below. The assignment of these numbers is dealth with in the
      Appendices. The scales are defined as linear, so that a combatant with
      Strength 12 is twice as strong as one with Strength 6. The upper limits are
      guidelines only, but strange results may occur if these are exceeded.</p>

    <p>Strength &#8212; Measure of combatant's ability to apply force, affects ability
      to hurt opponents. (1&#8211;20)</p>

    <p>Dexterity &#8212; Measure of combatant's co-ordination, affects ability to use a
      weapon. (1&#8211;20)</p>

    <p>Constitution &#8212; Measure of combatant's physical fitness, affects stamina in
      a fight. (1&#8211;20)</p>

    <p>Willpower &#8212; Measure of combatant's mental self-control, affects ability to
      fight when wounded. (1&#8211;20)</p>

    <p>Training &#8212; Measure of a combatant's knowledge of the use of a particular
      weapon. (1&#8211;10)</p>

    <p>Each combatant's equipment is also pre-determined. One or more weapons and
      possibly a shield are selected from the Weapons Table, and an armour type
      selected from the Armour Table. Limitations are again discussed in the
      appendices.</p>

    <h3>Calculation Of Abilities</h3>

    <p>The pre-determined characteristics are used with data from the tables to
      calculate the figures required for combat.</p>

    <p><em>Skill-Factor:</em> Calculated for each weapon, including shield if
      carried; measures ability to use weapon.</p>

    <p>Skill = (Dexterity/4) x ln(Training + 1) x Armour Factor 4</p>

    <p>Armour Factor is read from Armour Table. ln is natural logarithm. Measure
      to one decimal place.</p>

    <p><em>Anti-Parry:</em>Calculated for each weapon, measures likelihood of
      weapon hitting an opponent.</p>

    <p>AP = Skill x A</p>

    <p>A is read from Weapons Table.</p>

    <p><em>Parry-Stab:</em> Calculated for each weapon, measures defensive
      potential against stabbing attack.</p>

    <p>PS = Skill x DS + 12</p>

    <p>DS is read from Weapons Table.</p>

    <p><em>Parry-Cut:</em> Calculated for each weapon, measures defensive
      potential against cutting attack.</p>

    <p>PC = SKill x DC + 16</p>

    <p>DC read fron Weapons Table.</p>

    <p><em>Blow Strength:</em> Calculated for each weapon, measures how much
      damage will be inflicted when an opponent is hit.</p>

    <p>BS = Strength + B</p>

    <p>B read from Weapons Table.</p>

    <p><em>Base Speed:</em> Calculated for each weapon, gives time required to
      make a blow including backswing and follow-through.</p>

    <p>Speed = 20 &#8212; Skill + Armour Modifier + Weapon Modifier</p>

    <p>Armour and weapon modifiers are read from the tables.</p>

    <p><em>Move Rates:</em> Time taken to move one metre at walk and run speeds.
      Read from Armour table.</p>

    <p><em>Fatigue Limit:</em>Measurement of stamina and ability to take
      blows.</p>

    <p>FL = Strength + Constitution + 6</p>

    <p><em>Dodge Factor:</em> Measures defensive potential when dodging. Depends
      on best skill in a weapon. Active Dodge Factor is the potential used when a
      combatant deliberately dodges. Passive Dodge Pactor is the potential used
      when the dodge is due to usual movement.</p>

    <p>ADF = Best Skill x 2 + 16</p>

    <p>PDF = Best Skill + 8</p>

    <p>Note: all attack and defence figures are rounded down to integer
      values.</p>

    <h3>Weapons</h3>

    <p>Each type of weapon is given a set of data in the Weapons Table which
      define its use in combat. The figures A, B, DS, DC and Weapon Modifier have
      already been specified above. Weapons also have a range, short, medium or
      long, which defines the distances over which it can be used.</p>

    <h3>Armour</h3>

    <p>Each type of armour is given a protection factor for each area of a
      combatant's body. This is how effective it is at reducing injury when that
      area is hit by an opponent's weapon. In addition to these, the Armour Table
      also gives Move Rates, Armour Factor and Armour Modifier specified above. An
      armour type not given in the table can be created by specifying protection
      factors and deriving the other data by taking the closest giver armour
      type.</p>

    <h2>Procedure and timing</h2>

    <h3>Time Clock And Actions</h3>

    <p>All events take place on a time scale measured in nominal tenth of a
      second. Combatants make actions: moving, making a blow etc&#8230; Each action
      requires a given number of tenths to complete and is considered to have taken
      place at the end of this time. A clock is kept, marking the current time, and
      each combatant has a current action specified. Defensive actions &#8212; parrying
      and dodging &#8212; take place when required, but delay the completion of the
      current action. All actions apart from these take a minimum time of one
      tenth.</p>

    <h3>Modifiers</h3>

    <p>When a combatant requires or is forced to make two or more actions at one
      time, usually making a defensive action while making a blow the total time is
      specified as that for the major action plus a modifier for each extra action.
      The major action is making a blow, moving or an action from the Special
      Situations in Section Two. If two such actions are being made at,once then
      the times are added. Modifiers for other actions are listed in the Timings
      Table.</p>

    <h3>Reaction Times</h3>

    <p>When an event occurs which a combatant is aware of &#8212; in front and in sight
      or a noise from anywhere &#8212; his current action may be altered to allow for
      this. The time for the new action will be modified by a reaction time of d10
      - Best Skill, minimum one. If the event forces a reaction, usually an attack
      from a new opponent, then a reaction time is added to the current action.</p>

    <h2>Movement</h2>

    <p>All events take place on a hex grid with a scale of one hex to the metre.
      12 mm hexes with combatants represented by 25mm figures is usual. Each
      combatant is oriented by being given a facing, and the hex ahead of him and
      the two to the sides are defined as front. The other three hexes are defined
      as back.</p>

    <p>To move into a front hex takes a time given by the appropriate move rate.
      To move into a back hex takes twice this time. In order to run it is
      necessary to first move at the walk rate, walking front to run front and
      similarily to move back. Stopping running occurs when some other action is
      made. To change facing and turn through 60 degrees takes the same time as the
      run move rate. Turning can be done while continuing to run. If a hex is
      obstructed by a fallen combatant or other obstacle, it must be entered and
      left at a walk, and turns take twice the usual time.</p>

    <h2>Mechanics of Attack and Defense</h2>

    <h3>Making An Attack</h3>

    <p>When a combatant has an opponent, in range, he may make a.n attack, or
      blow, the time required being the base steed. In range hexes are show below
      for weapons held in the right hand. The triangle symbolises the combatant and
      his facing. Left handed weapons take the mirror image. For two-handed
      weapons, the controlling hand determines the pattern of in-range hexes.</p>

    <img height="275" width="150" alt="in-range hexes" title="in-range hexes" src="rs1.png" />

    <p>The defender chooses to Active Dodge or to Parry, or else makes no active
      defence &#8212; Passive Dodge. Whether the parry is against a stab or a cut depends
      on the attacker's weapon. A Parry cannot be made if the attacker is not in a
      covered hex. Covered hexes are shown below for left hand shield or weapon on
      the left, and right hand on the right &#8212; all hexes ahead, and all whole hexes
      ahead of the 90 degree line.</p>

    <img alt="Covered hexes" title="Covered hexes" src="rs2.png" />

    <p>A Dodge can be made if the attacker is in a covered hex for either hand.
      An active defence cannot be made if the attacker is behind the defender or if
      the attacker is not the defender's target. In such cases a Passive Dodge is
      automatically made, unless the defender is making no action when a defence
      potential of zero is used.</p>

    <p>The attack is resolved by adding a d20 roll to the attacker's Anti-Parry
      and comparing this with the appropriate defence potential. If the Anti-Parry
      is equal to or greater than the defence potential the attacker has hit his
      opponent. If not then the attack has been parried or dodged. However, if the
      die roll is 20, the attack always hits, and if the roll is 1 it always fails.
      These are called critical rolls and are treated slightly differently to other
      attacks.</p>

    <p>Note that an attack that hits is one that injures an opponent. A parried
      or dodged attack may have glanced off, but this is not important.</p>

    <h3>Hit locations and damage factor</h3>

    <p>When a blow hits, a further d10 is rolled to determine the part of the
      defender's body that has been hit, by cross-referencing the roll with the
      weapon type on the hit location table.</p>

      potential. on the Damage Factor Table. [Table omitted. A good approximation
      is to take a value equal to blow strength plus excess, divide by 4 and round
      to the nearest integer (but not below 1)] This gives the damage factor for

    <h3>Critical Rolls</h3>

    <p>When an attacker makes a critical hit by rolling 20, the attack excess is
      calculated differently. A d10 is rolled and added to excess as calculated
      normally to give the critical excess. If this is less than five, including if
      it is negative, it is counted as five. If the dl0 roll is ten, hit location
      is not rolled but is chosen by the attacker. The remainder of the injury
      determination then proceeds as above.</p>

    <p>When an attacker misses critically by rolling 1, he is unable to start a
      new action or defend actively for a short time. This time is found by rolling
      a d10 and adding two. This is instead of the afterblow procedure for the
      attacker given below, but that procedure still applies for the defender.</p>

    <h3>Movement Due To Dodging</h3>

    <p>When a defender dodges, he moves one hex to the back, the time for this
      being the dodging modifier added to his current action. The direction moved
      is determined by rolling a d6 and using the table below. The defender chooses
      which side is used to bias the direction obtained (column) and rolls for the
      result (row).</p>

    <p>If the hex obtained is blocked, either by a wall or by an opponent in a
      blocking position or is occupied by another combatant, the dodge cannot be
      made and the defence is treated as a Passive Dodge. If the hex obtained is
      obstructed by such as a fallen body, or if the hex initially occupied by the
      defender is obstructed, then a Saving Throw against Dexterity is made. If
      this is succesful the Dodge is made, but if it fails it is treated as for the
      case of a blocked hex.</p>

    <h3>After A Blow</h3>

    <p>Immediately after a blow is made, one combatant (the one who made the hit)
      has an advantage. He is allowed to make a move simultaneously with some other
      action ignoring modifiers. The combatant without the advantage has a two
      tenths &#8220;dead time&#8221; added to the time for his current or newly staring
      action.</p>

    <h2>Injuries and Stamina</h2>

    <h3>Types of injury</h3>

    <p><strong>Bruise:</strong> Self-explanatory. Has no effect on attack and
      defence. Affects stamina by adding one to fatigue noint total. Two Bruises in
      the same area consititute a Light Wound.</p>

    <p><strong>Light Wound:</strong> A gash upto 7cm in length and 2 cm deep or a
      bruise covering more than 12 cm<sup>2</sup>. Has no affect on AntiParries or
      defence potentials. Adds a modifier of two tenths to the current action. Adds
      two fatigue points. Two Light Wound in the same area constitute a Wound.</p>

    <p><strong>Wound:</strong> Considerable damage without affecting any major
      organs. Examples &#8212; 15 cm long, 5cm deep cut, or fracturing of a minor bone.
      Subtracts one from all Anti-Parries and two from all defence potentials. Adds
      a modifier of four tenths to the current action. Adds four fatigue points.
      Two Wounds in one area count as a Serious Wound, three as a Disablement.</p>

    <p><strong>Serious Wound:</strong> Damage to, organs, breaking of bones. If
      not treated will cause death. After receiving one a combatant must make a
      Saving Throw against Will Power. If this fails the combatant will pass out
      falling to the ground. If successful the effects are as follows. Subtracts
      two from all Anti-Parries and four from all defence potentials. Adds eight
      tenths to the current action. Adds eight fatigue points. A Serious Wound plus
      a Wound in the same area counts as a Disablement, two Serious Wounds will
      Sever a limb or cause Death elsewhere.</p>

    <p><strong>Disablement:</strong> A mortal injury unless rapidly treated.
      Means damage to vital organ, destruction of a non-vital one, multiple
      fracturing or severe mangling of a limb. A combatant passes out on receiving
      one.</p>

    <p><strong>Sever:</strong> Loss of limb or sufficient damage to render it
      useless. A combatant passes out on receiving one.</p>

    <p><strong>Death:</strong> Injury causing death instantly.</p>

    <h3>Fatigue</h3>

    <p>All injuries have a fatiguing effect, counting a number of fatigue points
      detailed above. Fatigue points are also accumulated for other activities as
      follows, one point for each. Starting to run; Running for 50 tenths; Making
      an attack; Dodging; Charging (in addition to running).</p>

    <p>When not performing any of the above, fatigue points are recovered at a
      rate of one per twenty tenths. Recovered points are recorded serarately as a
      maximum equal to a combatant's Constitution can be recovered on this
      timescale. Fatigue has no effect until the total taken exceeds half a
      combatant's Fatigue Limit. Then the times for all actions are increased by
      one and all Anti-Parries, defence potentials and blow Strengths are decreased
      by one. Blow Strengths are decreased by one for every fatigue point over this
      level. Times are increased by one for every two fatigue points, and
      Anti-Parries and defence potentials decreased by one for every three fatigue
      points. These effects are removed if the fatigue points are recovered. If a
      combatant takes fatigue points equalling or exceeding his Fatigue Limit then
      he must make a Saving Throw against Will Power, the latter being reduced by
      one for every point taken over the Limit. If he fails then he passes out. A
      further Saving Throw is made whenever further fatigue points are taken.</p>

    <h3>Saving Throws</h3>

    <p>A Saving throw is made whenever a combatant is involved in a difficult or
      unusual situation and indicates how he fares. Three d6 are rolled and the
      total score added. This is then compared to an appropriate characteristic
      &#8212; usually Will Power or Dexterity, sometimes slightly modified &#8212; and if it is
      less than or equal to the characteristic the Saving Throw is successful.</p>

    <h1>Special Situations</h1>

    <h2>Closing for combat and breaking off</h2>

    <h3>Closing</h3>

    <p>When a combatant wants to make a move which will bring him into a hex such
      that he or an opponent can make an attack, or when he expects an opponent to
      make such a move he makes a closing action. The opponent also makes a closing
      action unless he is already in combat or being approached from the back.
      After making a closing action which results in an attack by one combatant,
      both combatants are in combat. They remain such until they break off. Closing
      actions are as follows:</p>

    <p><strong>Set:</strong>Make no move but prepare to attack as soon as
      opponent is in range. Attack made after base time or one tenth after opponent
      comes in range, whichever is later. Takes one tenth and gives no
      advantage.</p>

    <p><strong>Wait:</strong> Let opponent make first attack, making no move. Add
      two to defence potential against opponent's first attack. Takes one tenth.</p>

    <p><strong>Attack:</strong> Move one hex and make attack. No advantage. Takes
      Base Speed + Walk Move Rate - 3 tenths. The move is made two tenths before
      the full time and the attack at the end of it.</p>

    <p><strong>Defend:</strong> Move one hex and let opponent make first attack.
      Add two to defence potential against opponent's first attack. Time is Walk
      Move Rate.</p>

    <p><strong>Charge:</strong>Move two hexes and make attack. Adds three to
      Anti-Parry to own first attack. Subtracts three from defence potential
      against opponent's first attack. Time as for Attack, second move is made two
      tenths before full time and the first move Run Move Rate before that.</p>

    <p><strong>Avoid:</strong>Move back to attempt to remain out of range.</p>

    <p>If the closing actions result in one or both combatants being unable to
      make an attack then that attack is lost and so is any bonus.</p>

    <p>After the closing actions and an attack being made the two combatants are
      in combat. They make blows, move and defend with the standard timings. It is
      not possible to make another closing action without first breaking off.</p>

    <h3>Breaking Off</h3>

    <p>Combatants break off when both are out of range and so cannot attack. This
      can happen automatically due to dodging or ordinary movement. Movement due to
      dodging need not result in a break off as the combatant with the advantage
      can immediately move back into range. A break off can also be achieved by ode
      combatant making a Retreat action. This consists off two moves back plus upto
      two turns all as a single action. It can only occur immediately after an
      attack has been succesfully stopped, when the combatant has the advantage.
      The time for this action is that for a single Walk Back. The advantage move
      is incorporated as Dart of the Retreat. During the time for a Retreat no
      actzve defence can be made</p>

    <h2>Multiple Combatants</h2>

    <p>When two combatants both make a closing action each nominates the other as
      &#8220;target&#8221;. The target is the only opponent that can be attacked and the only
      opponent against whose attacks an active defence can be made. A combatant who
      is the target of two or more opponents may choose to defend only and then can
      specify two targets. He is then able to make active defences against the
      attacks of both unless they make attacks at the same time when only one is
      defended against, chosen at random. A combatant may change his target, and
      this takes a reaction time = d10 - Best Skill, minimum one. To change to the
      defend only way of fighting takes the time required to select the new target,
      and a similar reaction time is required to change back. While changing target
      no active defence is possible. It is not necessary for a target to be in
      range. A combatant may choose his target to be one opponent who is out of
      range despite being attacked by another. The target is an opponent whose
      actions are being watched, and a combatant will know the current action of
      his target, but not of any other combatant. A target cannot be to the back of
      a combatant. A combatant is never forced to react by his target unless
      theoptional surprise rules are being used. Reaction is always forced by the
      attack of a non-target.</p>

    <h2>Blocking and moving past</h2>

    <p>Instead of making attacks, a combatant using a long weapon may take up a
      blocking position to prevent an opponent from entering certain hexes. The
      three possible blocking positions are illustrated below.</p>

    <img height="110" width="225" alt="Blocking positions" title="Blocking positions" src="rs3.png" />

    <p>When an opponent tries to enter a blocked hex the blocker makes a
      &#8220;blocking attack&#8221; with the opponent's defence potential being reduced by two.
      If the &#8220;attack&#8221; is successful the opponent is forced to remain in his
      previous hex, being considered to have stopped if he was running. If the
      attack fails the opponent moves into the hex and the blocking combatant is no
      longer in a blocking position. Initiative and dodging are treated in both
      cases as for a normal attack, with a roll of 20 always blocking and a roll of
      l always failing, but not having any other effect. To take up aa blocking
      position takes Base Speed -5 tenths and to move from one position to another
      takes Base Speed -10 tenths. A blocking position is maintained until the
      weapon is used to attack or defend. It is lost at the beginning of the time
      for an attack. A blocking position cannot be taken up if one of the blocked
      hexes is already occupied.</p>

    <h2>Combat at close quarters</h2>

    <p>A combatant using a short range weapon may attempt to come into close
      quarters by entering the same hex as his opponent. This is done by parrying
      or dodging the the opponent's attack when in an adjacent hex with the attack
      failing by at least two. This is similar to passing a block but no specific
      blocking action is required. It is also possible to come into close quarters
      as the result of a closing action, particularily when approaching from the
      back.</p>

    <p>When in close cuarters only short range weapons may be used, and dodging
      is the only possible active defence. (The optional unarmed combat rules allow
      other possibilities.) After a successful dodge, the two combatants are no
      longer in close quarters, but if an attack is successful, the attacker can
      use the advantage gained to remain close.</p>

    <h2>Weapon Combinations and uses</h2>

    <h3>One Single-Handed Weapon</h3>

    <p>A combatant so armed uses this weapon for all attacks and parries. A parry
      cannot be made at the same time as an attack, but can be made at all other
      times, a modifier of four tenths being used.</p>

    <h3>Single-Handed Weapon Plus Shield</h3>

    <p>The weapon is used for all attacks except at close quarters, and either
      may be used for parrying, except when the weapon is being used to make an
      attack. A modifier of two tenths is used for shield parries land one of four
      tenths for weapon parries.</p>

    <h3>Two Single-Handed Weapons</h3>

    <p>These can be used in two ways. One can be used as the only attacking
      weapon and then this is treated exactly as for weapon plus shield.
      Alternately, both can be used for attacks. In this case a combined base speed
      is calculated the average of the seperate speeds plus two, any halves being
      rounded up. The first attack when closing is made with a chosen first weapon
      after the combined base speed. After this attacks are made alternately, those
      of the first weapon making the combined base speed and those of the second
      coming being similarily spaced but occuring mid-way between the others,
      halves again rounded up. Either weapon may be used for parries, a modifier of
      four being added to the times for both. Two is subtracted from the
      Anti-Parries of both weapons. To change from one style to the other takes a
      reaction time.</p>

    <h3>Two Handed Weapon</h3>

    <p>All long weapons require the use of two hands. The Strength used to
      calculate Blow Strength is the combatant's two-handed strength which is one
      and a half times the ordinary strength, rounding halves down. These are the
      only weapons which can be used to block, but apart from this they are treated
      as for one single-handed weapon.</p>

    <h3>Changing Weapons</h3>

    <p>To draw a weapon or to replace it in its sheath takes a time equal to te
      combatant's Base Speed with the weapon To drop a weapon takes two tenths. To
      pick up a weapon from the ground a combatant must be in the hex in which it
      was dropped. This takes a time equal to two Walk moves. During these moves no
      active aefence can be made.</p>

    <h2>Simultaneous Attacks</h2>

    <p>When two combatants attack each other at the same time, they are unable to
      defend properly. Active Dodges and parries with the attacking weapon are not
      possible. Two is added to the Anti-Parry of each for the attack, and any
      modifiers for parrying with shield or second weapon is added to the time for
      the next action.</p>

    <h1>Missile Weapons</h1>

    <h2>Definitions</h2>

    <p>A missile weapon is any weapon which attacks at a distance and involves a
      projectile being launched, be it the entire weapon or some part. Types of
      missile weapon are listed in the Missiles Table.</p>

    <p>The following figures are required for the use of a missile weapon. They
      are either read from the missiles table or calculated using data from that
      table and the pre-determined characteristics.</p>

    <p><strong>Skill Factor:</strong> As for hand weapons.</p>

    <p><strong>Base Speed:</strong> As for hand weapons.</p>

    <p><strong>Accuracy:</strong> Calculated for each weapon, measures the
      likelihood of a missile striking its target.</p>

    <p>Accuracy = A x Skill + A1</p>

    <p>A and A1 are read from the Missiles Table.</p>

    <p><strong>Blow Strength:</strong>As for hand weapons, but is fixed for the
      type of weapon. Read from Missiles Table.</p>

    <p><strong>Velocity:</strong> Given for each weapon, measures how fast a
      missile travels. This affects the chance of it being parried and the time
      taken from launch to arrival at target. Read from Missiles Table.</p>

    <p><strong>Load Time:</strong> Calculated for each weapon, gives time
      required to prepare a weapon for launch.</p>

    <p>LT = L - Skill + Armour Modifier</p>

    <p>L is read from the Missiles Table, and Armour Modifier from the Armour
      Table.</p>

    <p><strong>Aim Time:</strong> Calculated for each weapon, gives time required
      to aim with weapon before launch.</p>

    <p>AT = M - Skill + Armour Modifier</p>

    <p>M is read from the Missiles Table, and Armour Modifier from the Armour
      Table.</p>

    <p><strong>Fire Time:</strong>Calculated for each weapon, gives time required
      to fire a loaded and aimed missile.</p>

    <p>FT = F - Skill + Armour Modifier</p>

    <p>F is read from the Missiles Table, and Armour Modifier from the armour
      table.</p>

    <h2>Mechanics of Missiles</h2>

    <h3>Procedure</h3>

    <p>When a combatant wishes to use a missile weapon it must first be drawn.
      This takes a time equal to base speed, as for hand weapons. For bows it is
      necessary to use both hands, but when using a thrown missile a combatant may
      choose to keep a single-handed weapon or a shield in the non-throwing hand.
      Launching a drawn missile then requires a sequence of three actions, Load,
      Aim and Fire, each taking the appropriate time as calculated above. The
      actions must be consecutive, and no other action can be performed during this
      time except turning which may be done during the Aim action.</p>

    <p>The Aim stage allocates a target for the combatant, which may be kept
      during and after firing. The Load action automatically nullifies the previous
      target. The target must be in a hex bounded by &#8212; but not including &#8212; the hex
      rows out of front left and front right faces from the combatant's facing.</p>

    <p>Bows and Crossbows cannot be fired at combatants in adjacent hexes (see
      range above). Load action for these weapons includes the time to draw a
      projectile.</p>

    <h3>A Missile Attack</h3>

    <p>At the end of the Fire action the missile is launched at the chosen
      opponent. A d20 is rolled and the score noted. The range is found by counting
      from a hex adjacent to the launcher to the hex containing the target at this
      time, using a route to give the lowest count. The range part of the Missile
      table is then consulted to give the range as short,medium, long or extreme.
      The velocity table is then used to give the time of flight.</p>

    <p>The earlier d20 roll is now added to the accuracy of the attacker and the
      total compared with the defence potential. For the definition of cover see
      below. The procedure is then followed as in for hand weapons. All missiles
      are treated as short stabbing the purpose of determining hit location.
      Advantage accrues to neither attacker or target, but if the target is hit he
      will take a 2 tenths &#8220;dead time&#8221; as usual. The critical roll of 20 is treated
      normally, but critical roll 1 is dealt with below. A combatant who is hit by
      a missile must always react unless the missile was fired by his target.</p>

    <h3>Critical Roll One</h3>

    <p>The attacker has misfired his weapon, and it drops to the ground, . Where
      it lands is determined from a dl0 &#8212; for 1&#8211;6, count clockwise from in front of
      the attacker as 1. 7&#8211;10 means same hex.</p>

    <p>In order to continue using missiles a new weapon must be drawn, or else
      the old one picked up, moving as necessary</p>

    <h3>Rapid Aiming</h3>

    <p>The Aim action can be replaced by a Fast Aim action. This takes a time of
      1 tenth. The accuracy of a fast aimed shot is reduced by 10.</p>

    <h3>Missiles That Miss</h3>

    <p>If a missile does not hit, its landing place isa found by taking the
      negative excess, that is the extra that would have had to be added to the
      accaracy for it to hit. If the negative excess is greater than 20 then it is
      taken as 20. Consult the figure below. The shaded hex is the intended target;
      the arrow shows the direction from which the missile approaches (hex edge or
      vertex), the excess gives the hex in which the missile impacts.</p>

    <img alt="Missiles that miss" src="rs4.png" title="Missiles that miss" height="165" width="330" />

    <p>If there is a combatant in the landing hex, then an attack is made that
      combatant. The attack potential is given by a fresh d20 roll, accuracy taken
      as zero. A 20 is still critical, but 1 merely means the falls harmlessly to
      the ground.</p>

    <h2>Situations involving Missile and Hand Weapons</h2>

    <h3>Defending Against Missiles</h3>

    <p>A combatant expecting to be attacked by missile weapons and not in comabat
      may choose to make evade actions. These are equivalent to running, but take a
      time equal to the walk move rate. Defence potential for an combatant is given
      in the missile defence table. A combatant may defend actively against a
      missile attack by his target. The &#8220;effective attack potential&#8221; is read from
      the velocity table, and a separate d20 roll made and added to it. This is
      compared with the defence potential. In the case of shields 5 is added to the
      defense potential. Rolls of 1 and 20 always &#8220;miss&#8221; or &#8220;hit&#8221; respectively, but
      have no further effect. If the attack is successful the missile attack is
      then treated normally, with the defender considered to be evading. If the
      attack fails, the negative excess from it is used as above.</p>

    <h3>Attacks On Combatants Using Missile weapons</h3>

    <p>A combatant using a missile weapon can make no active defence and has his
      Passive Dodge Factor rrheduced by two. If the attack hits he must react
      unless the blow is finished during a Fire action and the combatant making it
      is the target set in the immediately preceding Aim action. Other effects
      depend on the action in which the blow hits.</p>

    <p>During Load &#8212; the time for the action is modified as appropriate.</p>

    <p>During Aim &#8212; the action is cancelled; if the combatant wants to continue
      using missiles he must start again with a Load action.</p>

    <p>During Fire &#8212; the time for the action is not altered, all modifiers are
      added to the following action; the accuracy of the shot is reduced by the
      damage factor of the attack.</p>

    <p>When a combatant using missile weapons is injured, subtractions from
      Anti-Parries also apply to Accuracy, and additions to base speed apply to the
      times for all three missile actions separately. Blow strength, however, is
      not altered.</p>

    <p>Supply of Missiles</p>

    <p>The number of missiles carried by a combatant is recorded initially, and a
      tally kept of those fired. Twelve missiles is the usual number for bows, four
      to six for hurled weapons.</p>

    <p>If it is known where they fell missiles can be recovered and re-used. They
      can also be removed from injured combatants, wooden arrows having a 25%
      chance of breaking</p>

    <h1>Optional Rules</h1>

    <h2>Knock back</h2>

    <h3>Procedure</h3>

    <p>Whenever two combatants come into contact, either directly or through
      their weapons meeting it is possible that one of them will be forced to move
      by being knocked back. When an attack is parried, the blow strength of the
      parrying weapon subtracted from that of the attacking weapon, and the attack
      excess, which will be negative, is added to the result. The total is the Bash
      Score and this is used with the following table to determine the result.</p>

    <table border="1">
      <caption></caption>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Bash Score</td>
          <td>Effect</td>

          <td>below -10</td>
          <td>Attacker must move back one hex.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>-10 &#8211; 0</td>
          <td>None.</td>

          <td>1 &#8211; 5</td>

        </tr>
        <tr>

          <td>&gt;10</td>
          <td>Defender knocked over.</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>When the parrying weapon is a shield, the Bash Score is decreased by
      ten.</p>

    <p>The directions of movement are determined as for dodging, but otherwise it
      is treated as if the combatant chose to make walk back actions. For the
      effect of being knocked down see the next section. For an attack that hits,
      the Bash Score is calculated as attacker's blow strength - armour reduction in
      area hit - defender's strength + attack excess. It is then treated as above,
      except the attacker is never forced back.</p>

    <p>Knock backs have no effect on advantage or critical rolls.</p>

    <h3>Combatants That Are Knocked Down</h3>

    <p>When a combatant is knocked down the direction of fall is determined from
      the dodge diagrams, he then lies in his original hex and that given the dodge
      diagram. It takes ten tenths to fall. The combatant's current action is
      cancelled, and a reaction time necessary before a new one can be commenced.
      If the combatant had advantage due to the attack this kept.</p>

    <p>Damage may be taken from the fall. The short stab hit location table is
      used to determine the part of the body which takes the brunt. Blow strength
      is equal to the Bash Score causing the knock down and is reduced by armour as
      usual. Excess for the &#8220;attack&#8221; is given by a d20 roll - Passive Dodge Factor.
      A roll of 20 indicates a critical fall and is treated for a critical hit. A
      roll of 1 indicates that the combatant has landed well and suffers no damage.
      Except for a roll of 1, the &#8220;attack&#8221; always hits, and an excess of less than
      zero is treated as zero. However, a damage factor of one is counted as not
      injuring, and all other damage factros are reduced by one.</p>

    <p>When on the ground no active defence can be made. Getting up takes 3 walk
      moves unless the roll on landing was 1 when this is reduced to 2. For combat
      on the ground see Unarmed Combat.</p>

    <h2>Mounted Combat</h2>

    <h3>Horses</h3>

    <p>Horses have Strength, Dexterity, Constitution and Fatigue Limit as for
      human combatants. They have a Will Power between 0 and 10. They have a single
      combat Training, which must be at least 2 for them to be ridden in combat.</p>

    <p>Horses can be armoured with armour types as for humans, giving the same
      modifiers, factors and protection, except all legs have half the given
      protection, rounded down.</p>

    <p>Horses move at three speeds, Walk, Canter and Gallop. Their speed can only
      be changed up or down one category at a time. They take up two hexes and when
      stationary may keep either end fixed when turning. When moving the front end
      is always the fixed end for turns. The time for a turn is the canter move
      rate, but when cantering two moves must be made between each turn and when
      galloping four moves are necessary between turns.</p>

    <p>The horse is under the control of the rider. Whenever he wishes to turn or
      change speed he must make a control action, taking 10 - skill of rider
      tenths. The horse will respond 10 - skill of horse tenths later. The horse
      will always continue to move at its set speed after a turn. The response time
      of the horse is not an action, merely a delay between the the rider's control
      action and the earliest time the horse can respond. If the horse is partway
      through an action at the end of its response time it will finish that action
      before commencing the action ordered by the rider.</p>

    <p>The rider can sit forwards or back, that is he can choose to be in either
      the front or rear hex of the horse. He may also face forwards, right or left,
      giving a total of six riding positions. Changing position takes 10 - skill of
      rider tenths.</p>

    <h3>Attacking From Horseback</h3>

    <p>In range hexes for a rider with a weapon in his right hand are shown
      below. Whether the rider is sitting forwards or back has no effect. For a
      weapon in the left hand the diagrams are reflected through the line of the
      horse. The top row is for a short weapon facing front, right, left. The
      second for medium forward and right. The third is long forward and medium
      left. The bottom row is long left and right facing.</p>

    <p>Covered hexes are as for an infantry-man standing in the appropriate hex
      with the same facing. The following alterations are made to the combat data
      for attacks from horseback</p>

    <p>i) Base Speed is adjusted according to the first figure in the mounted
      combat table.</p>

    <p>ii) Anti Parries and Accuracies are adjusted according to the second

    <p>iii) Defence potentials are adjusted according to the third figure in
      themounted combat table.</p>

    <p>iv) Blow strengths for hand weapons are decreased by two.</p>

    <p>v) If the horse is moving during an attack action the attack potential is
      decreased by one for a turn or walk, two for a canter, or four for a gallop,
      only the largest counting for each attack.</p>

    <p>vi) All weapons are treated as long for the purpose of hit location
      determimation.</p>

    <p>Blocking actions are not possible from horseback.</p>

    <p>For attacks against another horseman see below.</p>

    <p>These alterations are to the rider's combat data only, not the horse's.</p>

    <h3>Attacks By Horses</h3>

    <p>A horse may be commanded to attack an opponent by a control action. It
      will commence the attack action on completing whatever its current action is
      when it responds. A horse with Training of 5 or more can be commanded either
      to make a single attack or to keep attacking a single target. In the latter
      case it will stop when the combatant falls or when it is given a command to
      do something else. A further command would be required for horse to attack a
      combatant on the ground.</p>

    <p>The required data are A = 1.8, B = 6 and modifier = -2. In range hexes are
      the horse's front end hex and the three hexes forward to it.</p>

    <p>After making an attack the horse has moved so that its front end hex is
      that of its target at the time of the attack. Its speed will be reduced by
      one category and its next action must be move at that speed. Thus a cantering
      or galloping horse cannot continue to attack the same target unless that
      target moves or is forced to move away from the horse.</p>

    <h3>Attacking Horse And Rider</h3>

    <p>The horse and rider are treated as a single target, but the attack is made
      at either the front or the back end. If both ends are in range, the attacker
      specifies which is being attacked at the time the attack is made. A d10 is
      rolled to see whether the attack is at horse or rider:</p>

    <p>Rider at end attacked is hit on 1&#8211;6; Rider at other end is hit at a 1&#8211;3</p>

    <p>Note that the rider may be notionally in an out of range hex if he is at
      the other end of the horse. He can still, however, be hit as the riding
      positions are merely convention with the rider being more accurately on the
      hex border.</p>

    <p>Regardless of which is being attacked, the same defences are possible,
      subject to the usual conditions of targetting and covered hexes. The possible
      defences are passive dodge by the horse, active dodge by the horse and parry
      by the rider. Passive dodge by the horse is assumed by default. For the horse
      to make an active dodge requires a control action so that the horse has
      responded during the time for the attack. The usual modifier of walk move
      rate is applied to the horse's current or just starting action, and the dodge
      diagrams used to give the necessary move. A horse with Training of 5 or more
      will automatically make active dodges against its own target's attacks unless
      commanded not to. Movement due to dodging is treated as a canter move in its
      effect on the rider, but not in terms the horse's speed of movement.
      Cantering and galloping horses cannot actively dodge.</p>

    <p>Hit locations are determined on the horse and rider hit location tables [I
      can't find these]</p>

    <h3>Interactions Between Mounted Combatants</h3>

    <p>When a mounted combatant attacks another horseman, blow strengths are
      altered by the relative movements of the two horses. One horse is towards the
      other if its last move action decreased the number of hexes separating their
      nearest points. If both horses are moving towards each other, and one is
      cantering and the other galloping then the blow strengths for attacks by the
      riders or the horses is increased by two. If each is galloping towards the
      other the blow strengths are increased by six.</p>

    <h3>Injuries To Horses</h3>

    <p>The normal wounds table is used to give wound types suffered by horses. If
      a horse takes a Wound it must make a saving throw against Will Power+Skill or
      else shy. This takes a time equal to that for two walk moves, and cancels the
      rider's current action. The rider may be thrown off. A d20 is rolled, and if
      this is more than 3 x rider's skill he falls. A roll of 20 always throws and
      a roll of one never. The fall starts at the end of the first walk move of the
      shy. For the effect of falling from a horse see below. The rider can only
      start a new action at the end of the shy, and he must first take a reaction
      time.</p>

    <p>If a horse takes a Serious Wound or a Disablement then this is treated as
      above except that the horse will shy before passing out, finishing the shy on
      the ground. If the rider does not fall off he must then dismount after
      reacting.</p>

    <h3>Knock Backs</h3>

    <p>Hits to the horse are resolved using the bash table as above; but if the
      horse is initially cantering or galloping the effect of being forced to move
      back is to reduce the speed by one category for each move. Once the move rate
      is down to walk, move backs take place normally. Knock down results are
      treated as the horse shying, ending on the ground. If the rider does not fall
      off he may remain in position while the horse gets up. During this time the
      rider can start no new action, though he can react.</p>

    <p>Hits to the rider are resolved using the following table</p>

    <table border="1">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Bash score</td>
          <td>Effect</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>below -10</td>
          <td>Attacker must move back one hex.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>-10 &#8211; 0</td>
          <td>None</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>1 &#8211; Skill Sum</td>
          <td>Horse moves back one hex</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>&gt; Skill Sum</td>
          <td>Rider knocked off.</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>Skill Sum = Skill of rider + Skill of horse.</p>

    <p>If the attacker is another horseman then the attacker moves back result is
      ignored.</p>

    <p>Effects on the horse are treated as above.</p>

    <p>When the rider is knocked off, blow strength used is Bash Score + 15 -
      Skill Sum, or 15 - Skill Rider if the fall is due to shying. The rider's
      landing place is determined from the diagram below (where the arrow indicates
      the horse) which gives the hex closest to the horse plus a dodge diagram to
      give the one further awsy. The rider lands with his feet closest to the
      horse. It takes 20 tenths to fall from a horse. Other than as above the
      procedure is followed as above.</p>

    <img height="90" width="110" alt="falling off a horse" title="falling off a horse" src="rs6.png" />

    <h3>Mounting And Dismounting</h3>

    <p>A rider can mount from the hexes 2,3,5 or 6 shown in the diagram above,
      providing at least one of the horse's hexes is one of the rider's front
      hexes. He can dismount into any of the same hexes with any desired facing.
      The horse must be stationary or walking for mounting or dismounting. The time
      for a mount or dismount action is 20 - Skill of rider tenths if the horse is
      stationary, 25 - Skill of rider tenths if it is walking.</p>

    <h3>Riderless Horses</h3>

    <p>A horse with a Training of four or less will stand where it is when
      riderless unless it is attacked, when it will flee. It will accelerate to a
      gallop and keep going until it is clear of all combatants or has taken
      fatigue points over half its Fatigue Limit. The initial direction of is
      determined from a dodge diagram.</p>

    <p>A horse with a Training of five or more will defend itself, and if its
      rider has been knocked off it will stand over him. It can also be given a
      control action before dismounting to move towards some objective. If it
      receives a Wound or worse, it will flee as for less well trained horses.</p>

    <p>Any riderless horse can be led by a combatant moving into one of its hexes
      and giving control actions. A riderless horse can be mounted by any capable
      combatant except in the case of a horse with Training five or more that is
      standing over its fallen rider.</p>

    <h2>Surprise actions and special manoeuvres</h2>

    <h3>Feinting</h3>

    <p>This action allows a combatant to apparently move in one direction,
      actually moving in another. The combatant makes a &#8216;false&#8217; feinted move,
      followed by two &#8216;real&#8217; moves, from the previous hex, in a different
      direction. The action takes a time equal to two walk moves, with the feinting
      move occuring after half the time, and the two real moves at the end.</p>

    <p>The feint must be declared secretly, including which real moves are to be
      made, at the start of the action. If no referee is present, the feint is
      marked on the combatant's order sheet and the current action announced as the
      feint move. Apparent feints where the feint move is also a real move also
      possible.</p>

    <p>A combatant may attempt to detect a feint by his target by announcing the
      attempt. This is not an action but must be announced after the feint and
      before the real moves. The detector's skill less his opponent's skill plus a
      dl0 roll is calculated. If the result is seven or less then the feint is
      detected. In such a case the feinting combatant is moved to where he would
      have been after the first of the real moves, and the second move is made
      normally. If a feint is not detected by a combatant, and that combatant
      wishes to change his current action as a result, then he must make a reaction
      roll. Only one attempt at detecting a feint is allowed for each move made by
      the opponent.</p>

    <h3>Hand Switch</h3>

    <p>A combatant using one, short, single-handed weapon may switch it from one
      hand to the other. This takes l0 - skill tenths. The switch action may be
      performed as a main action or as a modifying part of a blow. In the second
      case 2 is added to the attack potential for that attack, unless the switch is
      detected. Detection of a switch is as for detection of a feint above, with
      the announcement coming anytime within the attack action. A detected switch
      is treated as a normal attack for attack potential purposes. During an attack
      action with a switch or during a switch action no parry can be made.</p>

    <h3>Disarming And Breaking Of Weapons</h3>

    <p>When attacking an opponent who parries with a weapon other than a shield a
      combatant may make an attack to disarm rather than to hit. This is secretly
      declared at the start of the attack action. If the attack &#8216;hits&#8217; the blow
      strength of the parrying weapon is subtracted from that of the attacking
      weapon, and the damage category found for this effective blow strength. If
      this is four or better then the opponent is disarmed. If it is nine or better
      the weapon breaks. Critical roll 20 always breaks the weapon. Advantage,
      critical roll 1 and knock back are treated normally. If the opponent chooses
      to dodge the attack then it automatically misses except for critical roll 20
      which is treated as if the attack had been to hit. The landing place of the
      dropped weapon is determined by rolling a d10 and using the dropped missile
      weapon diagram above.</p>

    <p>It is also possible to disarm an opponent by parrying. An attack to disarm
      is made to prepare, that is the time is used but no attack carried out. The
      next time the combatant attempts to parry and is successful an attack to
      parry is considered to take place at that time, the opponent being forced to
      parry. The procedure is as above. If the opponent was attacking to parry both
      attacks to parry occur simultaneously, with the usual resolution for
      simultanoues blows. Thus both combatants can be disarmed at once. After each
      attempt at at disarming parry, including when the attack is not parried, the
      weapon must be re-prepared before another attempt is possible. During the
      preparation time ordinary parries can be made with the usual modifiers being
      applied to the preparing action.</p>

    <p>Broken weapons cannot be used in combat except as part of a hand strike as
      detailed below.</p>

    <h3>Diving Attack</h3>

    <p>A combatant using a short or medium range weapon may choose to make a
      diving attack as a closing action. This is only possible if the combatant is
      already running, and consists of two moves and an attack as a single action.
      The moves must be in the same direction. The time for the action is Base
      Speed + Run Move Rate - 5 tenths. Both the moves and the attack place at the
      end of the action. The combatant finishes the action on with his feet in the
      hext in front of his starting position, and his head in the hexx beyond that.
      The combatant's head hex must be such that the opponent attacked is within
      short weaopon range of it.</p>

    <p>The attack is made with 5 added to the attack potential and 6 to the blow
      strength. Hit location is determined as for a short, stabbing weapon, and if
      the opponent parries the attack is treated as coming from a stabbing weapon.
      During the diving attack action only a passive defence can be made.</p>

    <p>Getting up from the ground takes a time equal to that for three walk moves
      during which no active defence can be made.</p>

    <h3>Pulling Blows</h3>

    <p>A combatant may reduce his blow strength by any amount up to his skill in
      order to reduce the damage done to an opponent. Any reduction must be
      declared before the attack is made.</p>

    <h2>Armour and shields</h2>

    <h3>Non-Standard Armour Type</h3>

    <p>A combatant may have armour giving a protection factor upto 15 on any part
      of the body. To determine the effective armour type for calculating skills
      and finding move rates, the total protection factor over the whole body is
      summed up. Arm, leg and shoulder are only counted once each. The total is
      compared with those for the standard armour types and the nearest standard
      total above or equal to that chosen is taken as the effective armour type.</p>

    <h3>Shields In Passive Defence</h3>

    <p></p>

    <p>If a combatant is attacked by an opponent in a hex covered by his shield
      then his passive defence factor is increased by 5. This applies both when the
      combatant chooses not to actively defend, and when only such is permitted by
      circumstance.</p>

    <h3>Different Armour Construction</h3>

    <p>Armour can be made from a number of combinations of cloth, leather and
      variously formed metal. Different types of weapon will have differing
      effectiveness against the different armours. The armour construction table
      lists the main forms of armour and the protection factor each offers against
      a sword. The amounts by which these factors are adjusted for other weapons is
      also given as an addition or subtraction to the protection. For the purpose
      of determining custom armour type the sword figures are used. [I don't have
      this table]</p>

    <h3>Damage To Armour And Shields</h3>

    <p>When a combatant receives an injury with damage factor six or higher, his
      armour in that location is damaged. This has no immediate effect, but if
      another such injury is received in that location then that piece of armour is
      rendered useless. If a combatant receives an injury with damage factor nine
      or higher then his armour in that location is rendered immediately
      useless.</p>

    <p>Shields can also be damaged. An effective damage factor is found by adding
      ten to the attack excess of a parried attack to give the effective excess and
      using a protection factor of 15 to give the effective blow strength. If the
      effective excess is less than zero then the shield cannot be damaged. Shields
      are damaged by an effective damage factor of six and rendered useless by an
      effective damage factor of nine or by being damaged twice.</p>

    <h2>Unarmed Combat</h2>

    <p>A combatant may choose to use parts of his body instead of weapons to
      attack or defend with. This has the advantage of speed at the expense of low
      blow strength and short range. A single skill is calculated for unarmed
      combat as for a weapon, attacks in unarmed combat are punches, kick, grapples
      and throws.</p>

    <h3>Punches And Kicks</h3>

    <p>These are treated as weapon attacks. The required data for calculating and
      defence potentials, blow strengths and speeds is given in the unusual weapons
      table in this section. Note that in all cases blow strength is increased by
      the addition of skill to it. The medium stab hit location table is used in
      the case of kicks.</p>

    </table>

    <p>When parries are made by the hand, the attacking blow strength is reduced
      by adding the excess, which will be negative, and then treated as an excess
      zero hit to the parrying arm, except that a zero or negative blow strength
      does no damage. If the attack was to disarm it is treated as hitting the arm
      if succesful.</p>

    <p>Similarily if a punch or kick attack is parried, the attacker suffers
      damage from an excess zero hit with blow strength given by attacker's blow
      strength - 2*attacker's skill - excess for parried attack.</p>

    <p>If the arms or legs are armoured the blow strength is increased by two for
      protection in the range 4 to 8 or by four for protection in the range 9 to
      15. When hands or feet are likely to be damaged due to parries as above, the
      blow strengths involved are reduced by arm or leg armour as usual</p>

    <h3>Grappling</h3>

    <p>A combatant may grapple with an opponent by making a grab attack. This is
      equivalent to a punch with two added to the attack potential and no damage
      done. It can only be made at close quarters. If the attack &#8216;hits&#8217;, the two
      combatants are grappling. While grappling, only the combatant with advanatge
      can attack, and four is added to the attack potential for all attacks in a
      grapple. Any close quarters weapon may be used. Only dodging and hand parries
      are possible as active defence. Movement due to dodging happens to both
      combatants, and is in the direction determined by rolling a d6 to give a
      random adjacenthex. Both combatants move in the same direction, and both take
      the appropriate modifier for a dodge.</p>

    <p>Knock backs and knock downs do not apply to grappling combatants.</p>

    <p>Either combatant may attempt to disengage by making a disengage action.
      This is treated as an attack by any close quarters weapon against the
      opponent's active dodge, but with no possibility of damage and no actual
      dodge made. The combatant with the advantage increases his attack potential
      by five for a disengage action, and the combatant without advantage has his
      decresed by five. If the &#8216;attack&#8217; is succesful, the disengaging combatant can
      then make a move out of close quarters. His opponent may attempt to resume
      grappling if he can make a grab attack before the disengaging combatant
      leaves close quarters. If the non-disengaging combatant had already commenced
      an hand attack action then this becomes a grab action if so desired in such a
      case.</p>

    <p>While grappling the combatant with advantage must always be making an
      attack, disengage or throw action.</p>

    <h3>Throws</h3>

    <p>The combatant with advantage in a grapple may attempt to throw his
      opponent. This is treated as a hand attack with no damage, and if it is
      successful it is as if the opponent had been knocked down. The attacker,
      however, chooses which dodge diagram to use. The blow strength is given by
      attacker's hand blow strength + attack excess. The attacker may follow his
      opponent down and maintain both grapple and advantage, or else the two
      combatants are considered disengaged.</p>

    <p>A combatant on the ground may be attacked with any medium or long range
      weapon, or with a foot by a standing combatant. Only a passive dodge can be
      made as defence.</p>

    <h3>Grappling On The Ground</h3>

    <p>Grappling on the ground is treated normally, except no movement results
      from dodges and no throws are possible. The combatant with advantage is
      considered to be on top. In the case of a successful disengaging action, the
      disengaging combatant takes one walk move to get up, while his opponent takes
      two. Neither combatant may rise from the ground without disengaging.</p>

    <h3>Attacking Combatants At Close Quarters</h3>

    <p>If two combatants are fighting at close quarters, a third may attack one
      of them. If the attack misses, it is then treated as an attack on the other
      combatant, occurlng at the same time. If the two combatants are on the ground
      and the advantage changes during the time for the attack, three is subtracted
      for the attack potential for the attack.</p>

    <h2>Fatigue and Wind</h2>

    <h3>Wind</h3>

    <p>A combatant has a Wind of Constitution/2, rounding halves down. Any
      fatigue points incurred by the combatant are counted against this, not
      against Fatigue Limit. Fatigue points taken are reduced by one per 20 tenths
      when the combatant is not performing any fatiguing action. Provided the
      current amount taken never exceeds the Wind this will continue indefinitely.
      When the Wind is exceeded, the excess fatigue points and all those
      subsequently taken are counted against the Fatigue Limit. Fatigue is then as
      in the normal rules. Note that in the long term a combatant will recover all

    <h3>Athletics</h3>

    <p>A combatant may have a Training in athletics. A skill is calculated for
      this ability except Dexterity is replaced by ( Dexterity + Strength ) / 2.
      Armour has no effect on the athletics skill and so an effective armour of 1.0
      is used in all cases.</p>

    <p>A combatant with athletics Training has a Wind of skill in athletics +
      (Constitution x &#189; ), fractions rounded down after the addition.</p>

    <p>A combatant with athletics Training has move rates adjusted by using
      following table. Each move rate is cross referenced with the skill in to give
      the corrected move rate.</p>

    <p>When a combatant with athletics is injured or fatigued, the time
      alterations are applied to the normal move rates and the table used to give
      the new corrected move rates.</p>

    <h2>Special Weapons</h2>

    <h3>Rapier</h3>

    <p>A very fast weapon requiring very high skill for effective use. The skill
      of a combatant using this weapon is calculated normally and then treated as
      being three less for the purposes of calculating Anti-Parry, Base Speed and
      the two Parry Factors. The full skill is used for all other calculations.</p>

    <p>These are very long weapons, and must always be held in the equiof a
      blocking position, as shown below. Dark shaded hexes are blocked as above,
      the three light shaded hexes are the ones that can be attacked</p>

    <img width="225" height="110" alt="pole arm stances" title="pole arm stances" src="rs7.png" />

    <p>These in range hexes are not blocked. When in left or right position it is
      only possible to change to forward in one action. When a combatant turns with
      a polearm, the weapon moves round with him, and the turn cannot be made if
      this would put any other combatant into a blocked hex. The time for a turn is
      that a walk move.</p>

    <p>Attacks with a polearm are treated as for long, cutting weapons for the
      purpose of hit location. Blocked hexes remain blocked during an attack.</p>

    <p>Blocking attacks are automatically made when an opponent tries to enter a
      blocked hex. If the blocking attack is unsuccessful the opponent is allowed
      to move into the desired hex, but the block is not removed, and any further
      moves into other blocked hexes are treated as if coming from an unblocked
      hex. However, while there is an opponent in a blocked hex, a combatant with a
      polearm can make no attacks.</p>

    <p>Polearms can be used for parries against long range weapons only. Covered
      hexes are shown above, note that they include all in range and blocked
      hexes.</p>

    <h3>Lance</h3>

    <p>The lance can only be used from horseback and only by a rider with
      Training of three or more. The mounted combat table is used as usual to
      adjust combat data.</p>

    <p>To make an attack with a lance it must first be readied, taking a time
      equal to base speed. The attack is then made by moving forwards so that the
      target is in an in range hex. The attack occurs when the move is made. In
      range hexes are shown below.</p>

    <img width="110" height="90" alt="Lance attack" title="Lance attack" src="rs8.png" />

    <p>The rider must be sitting forwards before the lance can be readied and
      must remain so until the attack is completed.</p>

    <p>A lance attack is a closing action, but the target is designated when the
      lance is readied. Blow strength for a lance is adjusted according to the
      following table</p>

    <table border="1">
      <caption>Target is</caption>
      <tbody>

          <td>+2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Cantering</td>
          <td>+5</td>
          <td>+5</td>
          <td>+3</td>
          <td>+2</td>

          <td>+1</td>
          <td>0</td>
          <td>-1</td>
          <td>-2</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>Tha target is defined to be stationary unless the current or just
      completed action included a move. Direction of movement is as for horse vs
      horse with the target being considered stationary if the move had no effect
      on the separation. If the target is another horseman or horse then both
      galloping and cantering are treated as running for the target's motion, and
      normal horse to horse effects are applied in addition to the above.</p>

    <h3>Guns</h3>

    <p>Two types of gun are possible, the handgun, or pistol, and the musket.
      They are further categorised as being automatic or manual and whether they
      loaded with grapeshot or ball cartridges. An automatic gun expels a used
      cartridge and brings the next into the barrel as part of its fire action.
      Therefore, there is no load action required when using one. A manual gun has
      a load action as usual. Normally only handguns are automatic. Aim and fire
      actions are as for normal missile weapons.</p>

    <p>Two blow strengths are given for each gun in the Missile Weapons Table.The
      first is for grape-shot, the second for ball. When a combatant is hit by
      grapeshot, it is assumed to hit all areas of the body, and a damage factor is
      calculated for each separately. However, if the effective blow strength on
      any part of the body is zero or less, then there is no effect on that part.
      For ball shot a hit location is determined and used normally.</p>

    <p>When a shot from a gun misses, the usual diagrams are applied and any
      combatant in the hex given suffers the attack. However, the final landing
      place of the shot is undetermined.</p>

    <p>Critical roll 1 when a gun is fired means that the cartridge has not
      fired. The gun must be cleared before it can be used again. For a manual gun
      this is done as part of next load action, but the combatant must first take a
      5 tenths dead time plus a reaction time. For an automatic it takes 20 tenths
      plus a reaction time to clear the dead cartridge and load a new one.</p>

    <p>A gun holds six cartridges, and when they have all been fired it is
      necessary to reload. This takes 10 tenths for each cartridge loaded. It is
      possible to reload a gun which is not yet emptied.</p>

    <h3>Whip</h3>

    <p>A whip may be used to in two ways. It can be used for normal attacks as a
      long range weapon, with hit location determined as for a medium range
      stabbing weapon. Alternately it can be used to make entangling attacks. These
      are treated as normal attacks but with no damage, and if they hit a limb or a
      shoulder then the whip is wrapped around the opponent's limb, ensnaring him.
      The attacker may then either release the whip, which takes one tenth or
      attempt to throw his opponent to the floor with it.</p>

    <p>If the whip is released, it will take the opponent 5 + attack excess to
      get free, during which time he may make no active defence. Alternately, he
      may ignore the whip, in which case a modifier of one is added all his
      actions, and all his attack and defence potentials are reduced by one. This
      lasts for 10 x ( attack excess + 1 ) tenths or until the combatant chooses to
      free himself as above.</p>

    <p>If the attacker attempts to pull his opponent down, this is treated throw
      in the unarmed combat rules, with whip figures replacing those for hand.
      However, blow strength is taken as attacker's blow strength + attack excess.
      As the combatants are not grappling, the attacker cannot follow his opponent
      down. During the time for the throw, the opponent may attempt to release
      himself, as above. If he is succesful, the throw action is cancelled.</p>

    <p>A whip cannot be used for parries, but can be used for disarming attacks
      and parries.</p>

    <h3>Net</h3>

    <p>This is a non damaging weapon, which entangles an opponent on hitting. Hit
      location is not determined, the net is considered to cover a large area of
      the opponent's body. A net can only be parried by a long weapon or a
      polearm.</p>

    <p>If a net hits, it is always released. It will take the opponent 10 +
      attack excess tenths to free himself, during which time no active defence is
      possible. If he chooses to ignore the net and fight entangled, times for all
      actions are increased by five, and all attack potentials and defense
      potentials are decreased by 3.</p>

    <p>A net is a two handed weapon, but it is possible to hold any single-handed
      weapon at the same time as using a net. Only one of the two can be used at
      any one time, and timings and anti-parries are adjusted as for two
      single-handed weapons used at once. </p>

    <p>It is possible to make disarming parries against a net with any weapon.
      However, instead of the results given in that section, a net is unaffected by
      a damage factor of five or less, and torn by one of six or more. The net
      attack is treated as being against the opponent's passive dodge, and if it
      hits it will entangle as usual unless it is torn. A net has a parry factor of
      25 against disarming parries, regardless of the skill of the combatant using
      it. A torn net cannot be used in combat.</p>

    <h2>Terrain</h2>

    <h3>Ground And Movement</h3>

    <p>Move rates as given in the armour table, and for horses, are for movement
      on firm ground. Three other types of ground are considered, as outlined
      below. </p>

    <p>Soft ground is ground into which a combatant's feet will sink up to about
      three inches. Examples include sand and ploughed fields. Move rates of five
      or less are increased by one and all others by two. </p>

    <p>Muddy ground is terrain where it is necessary to lift the feet well clear
      in order to move. As well as mud and marsh this includes moving though
      undergrowth or shallow water. Move rates of three or less are increased by
      one, those from four to seven by two and those of eight or more by three.</p>

    <p>Difficult ground is water more than six inches deep, very boggy marsh and
      dense undergrowth. Move rates less than three are increased by two, those
      from four to seven by three and those of eight or more by four.</p>

    <p>Combatants with athletics Training adjust their normal move rates above,
      and then use the table above.</p>

    <p>Sloping ground is considered as soft, muddy or difficult according to how
      steep it is. It is considered to be equally difficult to move in all
      directions when on sloping ground. </p>

    <h3>Height Differences</h3>

    <p>It is possible for one combatant to be above another due to sloping ground
      or the presence of steps or platforms such as walls. The difference in height
      is measured in units of 20cm, called steps. For sloping ground that is
      &#8216;muddy&#8217; or &#8216;difficult&#8217; an uphill combatant is considered to be one step above
      his opponent. The uphill direction must be defined for any slope, one
      combatant is uphill of another if all possible routes between their hexes of
      shortest length include one move along the uphill direction. For steps and
      platforms the height in steps is defined when the terrain is set up for
      combat. Note that not all walls are sufficiently wide to permit movement on
      to them. To move up a step takes an extra walk move per step in addition to
      that for moving into the hex. Similarly for run moves.</p>

    <p>The effect of height differences on combat is as follows. For each step a
      combatant is above an opponent his attack and defence potentials are
      increased by one, up to a maximum of five. Hit location determination is
      altered so that the combatant above cannot hit the bottom 2 x ( number of
      steps ) locations and the combatant below cannot hit the top 2 x (number of
      steps). Thus if the height difference is 2 steps the top combatant has hit
      location determined from 1 to 6, and the lower one has from 5 to 10. If the
      height difference is six or more then no attack is possible. For a height
      difference of three to five long and medium range weapons are both considered
      to one category shorter for the purposes of in-range hex determination.</p>

    <h3>Obstacles</h3>

    <p>Hexes containing trees, walls, other combatants and similar obstructions
      are considered to be obstacles. It is not possible to move into an obstacle
      hex, except where the obstacle is another combatant when close quarters
      combat applies. If a combatant is dodging and the dodge diagram gives an
      obstacle hex, the dodge is cancelled, passive dodge applying instead,
      although the dodge modifier still applies. In the case of knock backs, if an
      obstacle hex is given, the combatant is knocked over instead. Note that in
      such a case the combatant may be supported by the obstacle rather than on the
      ground but the effects are the same.</p>

    <p>If there is an obstacle in a combatant's in range hexes when he makes an
      attack with a cutting weapon, then base speed is increased by one for each
      obstacle, and blow strength decreased similarily.</p>

    <h3>Cover</h3>

    <p>Terrain features can provide cover from missile attacks. Soft cover is
      given by hedges, single trees and thick undergrowth such as bracken. Hard
      cover is parapets, walls buildings, trees, mantlets, carts and similar
      constructions with the combatant partially visible. Arrow slits and other
      such cover occur only as specific terrain features.</p>

    <p>If there is any thing which would provide hard cover on the direct line
      between a missile using combatant and his desired target, the target is not
      visible. Other combatants can also block such a line of sight. </p>
