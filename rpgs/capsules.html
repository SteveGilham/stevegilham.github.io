    <p>These are my responses to the optional theme-for-the-issue posed in
      <cite>Alarums &amp; Excursions</cite>
    </p>

    <h2>How would you treat sentient plants?</h2>

    <h3>Should they be mobile? how would they communicate? How would they react
      to harvesting their fruit?</h3>

    <p>I never so much as considered this sort of thing in any of my games, even
      though Ents, the Aldryami, and the various plant peoples in Stapledon's
      <cite>Star Maker</cite> were part of the genre background. (My exposure to
      the possible motile sentient plants of <cite>SimEarth</cite> came only
      shortly before my burnout.) But I do have one war story about them.
    </p>

    <p>It was one of our &#8220;armageddon&#8221; games &#8212; a bring a couple
      of characters for a wild weekend's gaming &#8212; back in the mid 80s, aimed
      at superheroes and using <cite>Champions</cite>. As some players were lacking
      any <cite>Champions</cite> characters, they brought along character concepts
      for statting up. One of them was Pete Windsor's character, Falain, a
      sentient, motile tumbleweed, with a <cite>Judge Dredd</cite>-style hoverbike
      &#8212; apart from that it was generally a Pete character (aligned
      chaotic-daft); apart from its making disparaging comments about animals (the
      other PCs), I can't recall any other details at this decade-plus remove. ISTR
      that was also the game where another player had a swarm of killer bees
      &#8212; People's Attack Regiment #5 &#8212; with a yellow rain area effect
      NND.</p>

    <p>Not quite a sentient plant war story &#8212; One player's non-gaming wife,
      had managed to take on board, from games being held at their house, that
      Gloranthan elves were walking sentient plants; so some while after the
      Glorantha game crashed, and we were playing <cite>Shadowrun</cite>, she
      commented, &agrave; propos of something that the elf street samurai did &#8220;But
      aren't you supposed to be a lettuce?&#8221;<br />
      The character was ever after known as the Electric Lettuce.</p>

    <h2>(How) do you limit the spectrum of choice of PCs</h2>

    <p>My first reaction was: Doesn't everyone, at least when it comes to
      &#8220;genre appropriate&#8221;? But then I remembered the
      <cite>Arduin</cite> Techno character class. The real limitations I'd
      impose along with genre are &#8220;able to get along with all the
      others&#8221; and &#8220;plausibly sane&#8221; which are both fairly vague;
      and usually unspoken or implicitly expected of players. I have done &#8220;no
      non-humans&#8221; as an explicit limitation in <cite>D&amp;D</cite> games,
      but that has been a part of the setting &#8212; I've deleted the damned
      clich&eacute;s and added in different races without the usual baggage of
      preconceptions.
    </p>

    <p>I don't really recall any significant player reaction; the general
      principles are part of the cooperative playing style that evolved fairly
      naturally; a style that led to &#8220;Does not compute!&#8221; reactions when
      later once faced with <cite>Paranoia</cite>.</p>

    <p>There are a couple of instances where I should have limited but
      didn't &#8212; vetting character secret agendas up-front for the
      <cite>Vampire</cite> game (rather than having it explode into five separate
      solo stories), or helping a player doing a one-off appearance in out mid-80s
      <cite>Champions</cite> game who had no experience of the superhero genre to
      build a superhero rather than a fantasy character.
    </p>

    <h2>What makes for a Sense of wonder moment?</h2>

    <p>Thinking hard on this one, I think I can honestly say that the only gaming
      related sense-of-wonder experiences I can recall have been while reading the
      books, or maybe a decade ago (c.1991), trying to infer Glorantha trivia with
      a similarly minded friend. GMing is always looking at the scenery from the
      wrong side; and as player, the charge I used to get was adrenalin highs from
      chancy combat.</p>

    <p>One how not to do it with a really nifty setting is to play tour guide.
      Taking one example from experience, visiting Tada's High Tumulus in
      game is likely to concern itself more with logistics than any &#8220;gosh
      wow&#8221; one might derive from taking the old RQ2 Prax map and talking out
      the consequences of assuming that it depicts the tumulus to scale, never mind
      whether the other players are or are not Glorantha groupies at the time.</p>

    <h2>What's good or bad about Convention games</h2>

    <p>I had a brush with tournament style rules (a choose-your-stats
      <cite>D&amp;D</cite> where CHA was made useful by controlling how many times
      the player could speak during the game) at the first Dragonmeet I went to
      (c1980); and didn't stop to play. I've only actually played or
      run &#8220;delegate organised&#8221; games, haphazard pick-ups that were at
      worst forgettable.
    </p>

    <h2>What makes for Bad experiences</h2>

    <p>Well as I note <a href="biog.html">elsewhere</a>, they have all been about
      alienation from the hobby (not alienation as a tool within it), when I could
      no longer say why I was doing this thing. Encounters with dorks get
      forgotten, or maybe turned into war stories.</p>

    <h2>When is breaking character the right thing to do</h2>

    <p>I think one needs to take a utilitarian approach &#8212; what will bring
      the greater good for the greater number of those assembled to play. This
      covers the jerk chaot and narcissistic thespian cases nicely with reasons for
      breaking (or retiring) the character. It also stands against the breaking
      character just to follow along with what the GM alone wants.</p>

    <p>For me, keeping character usually led to PCs leaving the story to do their
      own thing off-stage, while ciphers prospered.</p>

    <h2>How have you used game mechanics to explore religion in your games</h2>

    <p>I never did much with this. RQ cults were the best mechanism I've
      given any time to &#8212; they did give a notion of concepts like
      &#8220;holy&#8221; that an entirely barren (i.e. state education requirement
      for religious instruction) Church of England background had only rendered
      meaningless.</p>

    <h2>What to do about occasional players</h2>

    <p>When in the past players have been unable to show up for one or more
      sessions, the characters have by default been played by the other players by
      committee, and somewhat in the background. In some genres (cyberpunk,
      superhero) it is easier to agree that the character is doing his/her day-job
      or similar schtick and can't respond to &#8220;Avengers Assemble&#8221;
      or whatever.</p>

    <h2>Does your GMing style vary by the rules set you're using</h2>

    <p>In hindsight, I can't see much difference in my own style in broad,
      save perhaps in some slight and gradual maturation over the years. There may
      have been a selection effect, in that games that didn't gel with my
      style I simply passed by.</p>

    <p>I also tended to treat games more as different ways to slice reality, and
      impose different limits on the possible; and can't off-hand think of
      any game which came with an associated setting that I have ever used the
      setting from, at least without having customised it myself, until at the very
      end when I used the <cite>Planescape</cite> setting.</p>

    <p>Even the late slide into a style which was more low-dice, narrative with
      adjudication came more as a response to trying to fit more than just a fight
      scene into an evening's play, and happened as much with
      <cite>AD&amp;D2</cite> as with <cite>V:tM</cite>! It was an exploration of
      what I could do to improve the execution of the game based on current
      received wisdom rather than being tied to the actual set of mechanics or
      genre in play.
    </p>

    <h2>How do you treat anachronisms like Futuristic Wizards</h2>

    <p>Futuristic Wizards are entirely OK if the genre accepts them (e.g.
      <cite>ShadowRun</cite>). Things like the <cite>Arduin</cite> Techno class
      are, as written, much more of a problem as their tricks would really need a
      large technological and industrial base to support, and thus don't ring
      so true. Like the old &#8220;mages can't use swords&#8221; argument,
      it's best if the players just take any limits as one of the canons of
      the game, and the worst is to respond to provocation with a tantrum &#8212;
      &#8220;I'll ban it forever!&#8221;
    </p>

    <h2>What helps players stay in character</h2>

    <p>I'm not sure my experience is typical. In recent years at least, the
      problem, when gaming in the evening after work, was keeping players from
      lapsing into a comatose state, rather than dropping to player level. Caffeine
      has little effect on the habituated. Worse, when players were out of the
      limelight, multi-tasking happens as people took to maximizing the use of
      their free time (reading, checking e-mail on laptops), to the extent of
      needing to prod people when their PCs' actions came round in combat.</p>

    <p>At that point a simple &#8220;Your turn&#8221; and a pause for
      context-switching sufficed.</p>

    <p>No-one violated character, but were active only fleetingly.</p>

    <h2>What r&ocirc;le does Party pressure play</h2>

    <p>This is more a player level set of agreed &#8212; even unspoken &#8212;
      conventions in my experience. The characters work together as a genre given;
      so I can't really comment on in-game effects.</p>

    <h2>Restarting old games - whether to and how</h2>

    <p>That's restarting as in a car, though one could have written revive, to
      avoid the sense of reinitialise.</p>

    <p>Ignoring essentially stillborn games, in my experience games falter most
      often for one of two reasons. The most prevalent is that the game mechanics
      have given way under play; restarting means porting to a different system, in
      which characters don't work like they used to, and it soon needs to be
      put out if its misery (after seeing it happen a few times, we stopped doing
      it).</p>

    <p>The other is that some of the players &#8212; often the GM &#8212;
      can't get out enough to justify what is being put in. This may manifest
      as the thread getting lost, perhaps due to pushing past a logical stopping
      point, or an acrimonious terminal session where divergent goals can no longer
      be smoothed over. In this situation, admitting that this is dead, and burying
      it is the only way.</p>

    <h2>Pulling heartstrings-friends and family as levers</h2>

    <p>I never did much with this. On the family side, starting RPGing at college
      when leaving home was a big step just being taken, characters had
      automatically done much the same thing. For those of us who stayed close to
      University, and especially those who have also refrained from breeding, the
      same lifestyle decisions seem natural. The only vestiges of such things were
      the DNPCs taken for a few odd points, when other disads have been mined
      out.</p>

    <p>But then much F/SF writing has the same conventions.</p>

    <h2>What do the players want the PCs to accomplish</h2>

    <p>I don't really recall having much in the way of grand PC-level goals. This
      was one of the difficult things about trying character play. The satisfactory
      games tended to be the ones in which what was to be accomplished was limited
      and tactical &#8212; goals like &#8220;Clear out the deserted Wiri colony on 3rd level&#8221;.
      Such goals, of course, arose on a player level, answering the question &#8220;what
      do we want to do tonight?&#8221;. The episodic nature of the games &#8212; dungeoneering,
      superheroics &#8212; lent itself to such tactical play. Adding continuity did tend
      to replace the answer of &#8220;whatever we feel like&#8221; with &#8220;whatever we were
      lumbered with as a leftover from last week, again&#8221;. This, in retrospect, may
      not be an entirely unalloyed plus.</p>

    <h2>What tips can you give about starting a gaming group</h2>

    <p>Thinking about it I guess I was always lucky, I always joined existing
      groups, already accumulated by someone I knew from university, so it was more
      a case of finding a group than founding it.</p>

    <h2>Creating a home base for PCs</h2>

    <p>In many cases, PCs were peripatetic, where not simply garaged somewhere
      abstract between weekly dungeon delves, so the issue rarely arose. In the
      earliest days, some characters had (off-screen) castles - something spend six
      figure fortunes on. My MU, Ororo, was planning to create a demi-plane, a
      cottage in an eternally summer garden in a small valley magically hidden in
      the middle of a howling snowy waste, the way in being through a gate in the
      wastes, but the campaign folded before she could organise the magical
      wherewithal. It would have had home comforts, defence in depth, and, most
      importantly, significant swank value.</p>

    <p>The one home base that had significant time invested in &#8212; both
      design and play - was Doc Savage's lab in the London Watch
      <cite>Champions</cite> campaign, but despite the fact that I did the job of
      putting it into a CAD system, the passage of the years has eroded memory of
      the design process. In that game I did have a PC with a defined <span title="foot hold, lit. foot to the ground"
        xml:lang="fr">pied &agrave; terre</span>;
      Pushover had a flat [never detailed] in the block containing the
      Women's Centre where she worked, but having been developed as a
      character, decided that the macho super-hero thing wasn't for her and
      faded out of play. [I'm getting my revenge now &#8212; an alternate
      version of her is co-starring in my latest fiction, and she's going to
      have to deal with being faced with the problem of saving the world this
      time.]
    </p>

    <p>There was a home base in the last <cite>AD&amp;D2</cite> game, a castle,
      but as that was the holding of the NPC Baron for whom the PCs worked as elite
      forces, it was a given, rather than being chosen. In the paratime/60's
      spy game, we were also eventually given a base, an alternative where a
      paratime capable civilisation had been wiped out. The most involved base-like
      stories with off-beat design criteria would have come from the local
      <cite>Ars Magica</cite> saga <span xml:lang="la">( <a href="http://www.quantal.demon.co.uk/"
          title="Set in Brittany, at La Roche Caribe">Saxum Caribetum</a> ),</span>
      where founding the covenant took most of the first realtime year's
      play, and it took a resolving a lot of squabbling about the library before
      construction even began.
    </p>

    <h2>Have you tried hitting PCs with a baby</h2>

    <p>One time, this was almost literal - a small child was used as a missile by
      a supervillain (Malice, of the Bad Girls) in a <cite>Champions</cite> game.
      It's not a very effective thing to do, as they are limited in the damage they
      can inflict by their low BOD and zero DEF. Paving slabs are more
      effective.</p>

    <p>As for the idea of inflicting parenthood, even adoptive or something like,
      and transient, it was never explored while I was involved. Heck, we
      didn't even have any &#8220;spunky kid&#8221; PCs (thank goodness,
      worse than kender&hellip;) The only episode I can recall in which children
      actually appeared was an almost off-screen incident in the
      Glorantha/<cite>RQ</cite> game where the PCs had returned to their home
      steading, and my Babeester Gor axe-murderess was co-opted by the Voria
      nursemaid as an assistant. This being a cult obligation, she grimaced, went
      along, and into an off-screen interlude.</p>

    <p>Subsequently in the same GM's <span xml:lang="la" title="Set in Brittany, at La Roche Caribe"
        class="breakline">Saxum
        Caribetum</span> saga, I gather the mages get involved in orgies, sparked off
      by faerie wine, which have resulted in offspring as well as points of
      <cite>vis</cite>, but I get the impression that the grogs are left to deal
      with the sprogs. There may be more sordid details on the campaign web page
      than I wot of.
    </p>

    <h2>Rules that players disagree with</h2>

    <p>Long, long ago, the real biggie was the wizards and swords one. We cured
      that one when one time the mages and thieves, the sole survivors of a m&ecirc;l&eacute;e,
      started to squabble over the division of the loot, drew swords and axes, and
      slaughtered each other <cite>tout de suite</cite>. Then they saw the wisdom
      of the arbitrary ruling. By the early 90's, it had even become one of the
      bits of antique charm of the <cite>*D&amp;D</cite> rules (another thing to
      dislike about <cite>3e</cite>) that made it attractive to pick up
      <cite>AD&amp;D2</cite> and play that rather than <cite>RQ</cite>.
    </p>

    <p>And nobody liked the fire-and-forget magic system, so we replaced it
      almost from the get-go.</p>

    <p>I can't remember any other focussed little rules that were
      contentious, though there must have been many. More often it was whole-system
      things not amenable to single-point changes (bricks <em xml:lang="de" title="Over all">&uuml;ber alles</em>
      in <cite>Champions</cite>, the system sagging by about 8-9th level in
      <cite>*D&amp;D</cite>, the unreasonable effectiveness of mages when played
      with a little thought in <cite>Shadowrun</cite>). The nearest to a point
      problem was with <cite>Pendragon</cite> (which we used in a Glorantha
      setting), where no-one liked the number of shots a slinger could get off on
      an opposing foot-soldier charging at him, a combination of range, rate of
      fire and movement rules conspiring together, but that was washed way by the
      other problems with that particular campaign.
    </p>

    <h2>Why are some players reluctant to GM</h2>

    <p>I can't say for sure about the habitual player-only type, but I
      might share some of the problems. For me, my reluctance to resume after
      burn-out was, and remains, centred about the problem of excessive GM
      authority in anything adjudicated. It's about not being able to sustain
      the necessary illusion of player free will from my PoV, while keeping the
      amount of GM prep needed to a manageable level. For a fully live
      quasi-simulation, a world that &#8220;runs itself&#8221;, in which the
      players can really do what they want, the workload is enormous (at least
      compared with the amount of time and energy I feel I can devote to it these
      days). That's before one faces the possibility that every player takes
      off on a separate agenda (as helped crash my <cite>V:tM</cite> chronicle).
      For anything constrained, I have to guide the players, and this feels
      wrong.</p>

    <p>On top of that, choosing a system, choosing how to customise it, can all
      lead to analysis paralysis even before getting to the crunch point of
      selecting a setting, and trying to set it in motion. And then you have to
      worry about whether your players will be happy to consume what it is you have
      to offer, whether they will propose characters that you can handle, and that
      won't do violence to what you wanted to run.</p>

    <p>It was all so much simpler when a satisfying evening's gaming could
      be put together by selecting opponents for two fight scenes and a skeleton of
      narration to join them up. Things started to go downhill when gaming evenings
      had to stop at half ten rather than one a.m., and violence had to be
      suppressed after the 9 o'clock watershed and/or speeded up by
      abstraction, and other things had to be introduced to fill the space. Nearly
      as good are the few very best pre-packaged adventures where the GM can just
      play the hand he's been given without needing to rewrite it to
      eliminate crass bits, and allow the time for the game system to produce
      results, rather than have to also make them up.</p>

    <h2>Saintly PCs - what makes them, what game mechanics might they use, and
      can they work in practice</h2>

    <p>I think we have to distinguish between pious characters and those who are
      merely holier-than-thou; and also have some ground rules on what the piety is
      being measured against to do this topic justice. How would a character
      that's not following something close to one of the Faiths of the Book
      be judged as saintly?</p>

    <p>It is true that many characters that say &#8220;pious&#8221; or
      &#8220;holy&#8221; on the character sheet actually turn out aligned simply
      Lawful/Obnoxious &#8212; the one I remember from local play being an LG dwarf
      cleric by the name of Aman Naug who came over as very austere and
      puritanical, and noted as to be one of the first against the wall when the CG
      revolution came. Most interestingly, when dusted off post
      <cite>AD&amp;D2</cite>, as a priest of Aurochs, lord of berserk strength (the
      <cite>CPHB</cite> Strength specialty priest type), he became the rather
      lighter-hearted Noggin the kung-fu barbarian dwarf in very short order. And
      he was doing a lot of righteous smiting as befitted his faith. Was he
      saintly?
    </p>

    <p>In a more familiar style, I remember affectionately the write-ups from
      long, long ago of the Tale of Two Clerics, two pious characters and their
      unfortunate companion, the rather more self-interested Frank (and all his
      relatives &#8212; replacements - of the same name). They sounded saintly, and
      certainly seemed to work.</p>

    <p>Had I actually completed character generation for Saxum, my character
      there would have been inspired by Roger Bacon, as portrayed in Blish's
      <cite>Doctor Mirabilis</cite>, and would have had a definite background from
      the Church, even if a mildly heterodox one, from time spent in the University
      at Paris, a pious inquirer into the majesty of Creation. As it turned out, I
      don't think he would have fitted the rest of the group, so that's
      saintly character that wouldn't have worked, but in that case only due
      to the particular context in which he would have been set.
    </p>

    <h2>Kill or stun - which to do</h2>

    <p>One reason to kill is when you cannot deal with the opponent in any other
      fashion. The last game I actually played had just about come to this point -
      the mind warping powers of the elves out of paratime were such that they
      couldn't be kept prisoner by mere humans for any length of time. So, for our
      own security, the only good pointy was a dead one.</p>

    <h2>What do you use for genre Sources</h2>

    <p>The one time I found I really needed to get players into the groove for
      anything I ran was <cite>Shadowrun</cite> when few if any of the players had
      read anything even vaguely cyberpunk-ish. To remedy that, I handed around the
      first accompanying volume of fiction, the <cite>Into the Shadows</cite>
      braided anthology, for them to read in advance of the character generation
      session. In other cases, my players seem to have already had some idea of the
      genre or at least conventions typical of these games absorbed by osmosis from
      the surrounding culture. The main exception I recall was a player who just
      wasn't into superheroes who joined in one session of <cite>Champions</cite>.
      I don't think a reading assignment would have helped in the short time
      available.</p>

    <p>The time I really went looking for genre material (as opposed to things
      like historical references for period context before finally not getting
      around to joining the Saxum Caribetum saga) was when running
      <cite>Vampire</cite> &#8212; and there it was easy enough to find source
      material in the usual bookshops &#8212; which I then plundered for NPCs.
    </p>

    <h2>Working around Combat Patterns (he hits, I parry)</h2>

    <p>I didn't play <cite>Ars Magica</cite> for long enough for the variant
      &#8220;He hits, I soak&#8221; to become clich&eacute;d, though my converted high-CON
      ex-<cite>AD&amp;D2</cite> Uruk Hai was very good at that version of the old
      standard. And it depends what you mean by a pattern &#8212; if you take the
      software engineering meaning, that really means a stereotype, in the same
      sense that that word used to have in printing, of a ready made format Opening
      gambits are a source of behaviours that often get thus stereotyped &#8212;
      &#8220;Here come the flying feet of Kung Fu!&#8221; or &#8220;We
      <cite>Starsky &amp; Hutch</cite> the door.&#8220; &#8212; a reference from
      when they were on the TV (as opposed to the 2004 movie), not that long before the very early
      <cite>D&amp;D</cite>ing
      days &#8212; the fighter knocks down the door while a mage stands ready to Magic
      Missile what may be revealed.
    </p>

    <p>But I guess the real intent of the topic was on the behaviour that emerges
      when you actually invoke the game mechanics. At this point the fact that each
      entity in its turn &#8212; and that encompasses even the different turn rates
      for different entities that is part of the <cite>Hero</cite> system &#8212;
      is given an action that may be used to attack, and that usually meets some
      implicit resistance from the target. The underlying game mechanics will
      always drive you to some variant of the the &#8220;I attack, he
      defends&#8221; iteration; even in <cite>Over the Edge</cite> and <cite>Feng
        Shui</cite>, no matter what their respective authors would like to have you
      believe.</p>

    <p>All that those games attempt to do is hide this inconvenient fact under
      layers of fluff. Such spurious detail has for me the effect of reducing both
      my immersion (as a distraction) and also the credibility of the action
      &#8212; I would rather hide detail I'm no expert in under the abstraction of
      the mechanics. Otherwise you get to the ludicrous things like in the
      <cite>Theatrix</cite> thread on r.g.f.a about 8 years back where what the
      acting player described in the belief that it is a strong move was resolved
      by the adjudicator taking the point of view that it was a weak one, or
      descriptions of a combat in terms of fencing stances (recalling a somewhat
      more recent thread on u.g.r or perhaps r.g.f.m). Not only am I not au fait
      with the technical terms, but I do not find it credible that such technically
      precise stances would be applicable to wilder melee &#8212; especially in the
      example I recall of a combat with a broo. This style of play also seems
      distressingly full of examples in which a player asserts what his opponent is
      doing as much as his own character.
    </p>

    <p>No, either you go to systems that plot moves at the sub-100ms increment
      with Laban Notation, using complex transition rules to simulate physical
      limitations on how far you can move, and that you can't move one arm though
      another, and computing whether you'll fall over given that current stance,
      and how to recover, and then you have to learn how to fight properly, for
      real, to use it &#8212; something I contemplated over 25 years ago, and then
      drew well back from &#8212; or you're stuck with the abstracted
      action/re-action iteration.</p>

    <h2>The difference between Old and New campaigns</h2>

    <p>How old is old? While 1960s rock stars may have talked the talk, my
      experience is of campaigns that actually did die before they got old. Usually
      I was introducing new campaigns (often also implying new systems) to old
      players.</p>

    <p>The only longish running campaign with some later introduction of players
      was the <cite>Champions</cite> game from the mid '80s. There, the genre
      conventions were strong enough, assuming the players understood them, that
      they could hit the ground running. In the case of the genre-unaware player
      cited above coming in later, I guess that the campaign in mid-flow had enough
      momentum to ride through that sort of local difficulty, whereas a newly
      starting one, with less player investment all round, might have foundered in
      favour of something more attuned to the new consensus.</p>
