    <h2>Geography</h2>

    <p>The maps below are 800km per hex at the equator, and show Europe for scale
      in the top left. The map extends to 70N and 70S. Brown is rough, green is
      forest, yellow is desert. Ocean currents and the southern continent and
      attached ice shelf are shown (the northern ocean has no ice-cap, just
      seasonal ice). The continent just above the centre is Homefall, the centre of
      the campaign (and the main landing site). The next continent to the
      north-east is High Haveen, which has some habitations almost as old.</p>

    <p>The players had a part of the map</p>

    <h2>Developing a character</h2>

    <p>Stats are 3D6 variables (but 2 may be chosen to be 10+2d4 or 11-2d4) Roll
      up/down at top/bottom of the range. Stats are Str,Dex,Con;Size, Build,
      Cha;Wis, Wpr, Int; Psi, Sanc, Atm. Women have -5 each Size and Build, +3 each
      Con, Cha. With no priest system, Sanctity and Atman were meaningless. There
      was a psi system, but it has been lost.</p>

    <p>Hit points = Str+(Siz+Bui)/2, if con &gt; 12, add points about 12, if
      below 9, take points below.</p>

    <p>Effective strength for combat is increased by the factor from the table
      below, and the effective dexterity is reduced by the same amount.</p>

    <p>Handedness &#8212; D12 for right hand, D6 for left; higher score is dominant.
      Subtract difference from the off-hand's agility (modified dex) and half that
      from its strength in combat.</p>

    <h2>Magic system</h2>

    <p>See <a href="dsys.html" title="Old magic system">.DSYS</a> for the outline. The main differences
      here were to have magic types and sub types, so you could specialise even
      further, at the cost of having the closely related spells just at par, rather
      than at bonus or penalty. The types were</p>

    <p>Enchanter = Dictor (word based and command magic), Quaesitor (detection) =
      Willpower<br />
      Warlock = Praetor Naturae (nature magic), Sorcerer (body magic), Surgior
      (healing magic) = Con<br />
      Witch = Aerior, Aquior, Gaeaior, Pyrior = Cha<br />
      Wizard = Pyrior, Luminor = Str.</p>

    <p>Note that Surgiors or Warlocks replaced clerics in this iteration.</p>

    <p>I did have an algorithm for the fatigue table I used &#8212; minus at Level L
      after casting N <strong>spells</strong> is (L^(N/2L) - 1) until linear, with
      an extra INT-12 free spells. Spells could be pushed &#8212; the excess doubled &#8212; at
      a cost of 4 extra spells.</p>

    <p>Saves against magic were based on a function of level (basic Magic
      Resistance Level being about 2 + level/2, some variation by character class),
      plus bonuses for wearing unenchanted armour (+4 for normal sized chain, +6
      for normal size plate), an extra +4 for not having magic talent, plus any
      specific enchantment bonuses. Roll adjusted MRL or below to save. A creature
      needing a +N weapon to hit could be hit by a character with (MRL-7)/3.</p>

    <p>Saves by dodging or against poisons were rolled against Dex of Con.</p>

    <h3>Combat System</h3>

    <p>Attack factor = Fighter level + 1/2 (Dex-10) - enc penalty</p>

    <p>Defense factor = (Fighter level/2) + 1/2 (Dex-10) - enc penalty</p>

    <p>D20 + Attack - Defense of 10 or better is a hit.</p>

    <p>Weapons are given damages against 5 armour types &#8212; None, Leather, Chain,
      Plate and Special, to which half of the effective modified Str is added (add
      1/4 offhand Str to main hand Str for two-handed use), plus a D6. Strengths
      above maximum are capped, and below minimum are adjusted to double the
      shortfall. Encumbrance base is 2 for leather, 4 for chain, 6 for plate,
      scaled up for large size+build, down for higher Str.</p>

    <p>Examples</p>

    <p>Greatsword 5/6/3/0/-3 Parry -12 Speed 6 min 20 (expects 2-handed use)<br />
      Battleaxe 1/-2/-6/-8/-14 Parry -3 Speed 3 min 14<br />
      Dagger 0/0/-4/-8/-12 Parry +6 speed 1 max 11</p>

    <p>Parrying exchanges the next blow for a type of defense. In this case, the
      attacker adds his weapon's parry value to his attack factor and subtracts the
      defender's weapon parry value (shields have a zero parry value). Initiative
      is D20+speed (low is good).</p>

    <p>Marksmanship is Level+dex-10, with a penalty of half the base enc for the
      armour type <em>per arm</em> for wearing armour on the arms (e.g. 1 plate arm
      = enc 3; one leather arm = enc 1, together enc 4), and there is a base
      defense factor modified by the range</p>

    <p>Examples</p>

    <p>Longbow 12/10/6/2/-3 damage -1/20m base defense 8 + 1 per 10 meters of
      range Str 15/Dex 12, 1 shot per round<br />
      Light crossbow 13/11/6/3/-2 -1/5m 0+1/8 Str 6 (14 to manually cock), 3 rounds
      per shot.</p>

    <h2>Encounters</h2>

    <p>Although I took over part of the <a href="newearth.html" title="My brother's old campaign setting">New Earth</a>
      game setting, I discarded not only the standard cleric, I also jettisoned the
      standard non-humans (well they weren't part of the manifest for the
      campaign). While the first strand of the campaign took up the Oktvabrina
      storyline, a separate thread investigated where strange weapons were
      arriving, and found evidence of offworld tampering (which then led to a
      world-hopping cmapaign, via world-gates, seeking to close off this route of
      invasion). Two types of off-worlder were encountered &#8212; Kintor, small and
      vulpine, and Hrulgani, large and ursine. They take roughly the elf and dwarf
      niches of traditional FRP, but only very roughly &#8212; spellcaster or
      high-finesse warrior as opposed to the unsubtle bruiser. They are drawn from
      the background of my <a href="../MovingDay/index.html">SF writing</a>, though
      none of those are spell-casters. The how-to-roll-up for these (and the
      Ayassa, who became a player character option at one of the stops along the
      way), are lost. I do remember that Hrulgani had low WIS (perhaps 2D8).</p>

    <p>Kintor standard battle suit &#8212; Armour type Special, 20 point zap every
      round, 10 shots of 40 point. Absorbs 25 points of energy per round, flies at
      30". The traded version had values Plate/5/10*20/15/24". Both gave night
      vision.</p>

    <p>Hrugani standard kit was Armour type Leather absorbing 10 extra points, or
      25 points of energy every round. Ground infantry used a great axe, while the
      aerial troops used a rifle (stats as crossbow with +10 damage, firing every
      round).</p>

    <h2 xml:lang="la" title="Members of the cast">Dramatis Personae</h2>

    <p>I even still have the character sheets from the <a id="Homefall">Homefall
        campaign</a>, and its subsequent evolution into plane-spanning. I shan't post
      their details (stats, possessions, weapons and such) here, but if any of the
      players read this page and want the details, I can send them. The roster
      was</p>

    <h3>Played by Martyn Wheeler</h3>

    <p>Patti (F7, human) with the gross magic longbow, Alin Karadh &#8220;the Mad Axe
      Murderer&#8221; (F10, human), who was the wielder of Glass, the gate-closing axe
      (much like Changeling from CJ Cherryh's <cite>Gate of Ivrel</cite>), Chenin
      (F9/MU8, human) with a longbow and staff of power, and a black cat familiar.
      I remember her for the heartfelt cry of &#8220;they die&#8221; when after many arrows,
      she brought down one of the first encountered Kintor in their flying suits.
      And for Martyn's cry of &#8220;raise the cat first&#8221; when both were crisped by a
      fireball (and she had less than twice the number of hit-points it had).</p>

    <h3>Played by Pete Windsor</h3>

    <p>Enthom (MU7) and his boring nondescript bodyguard Bryan Non-entity (F11).
      Bryan later went on to pick up the artifact sword Sundancer, and from then on
      has had the role of Sundancer's Feet. Thean (Priest3/Psi3)</p>

    <h3>Played by Pete Hutchison</h3>

    <p>Toyah (Th2/F4, Ayassa, deceased), Tom (F4, human)</p>

    <h3>Played by Rob Corlett</h3>

    <p>Erlan (F6, deceased), Charlemagne (MU5/Psi3), Golana (MU7/F1/Th1)</p>

    <h3>Played by Sue Lambiris</h3>

    <p>Hiratia (F11/MU7) She picked up Moonsinger, Sundancer's complement.
      Letillian (F6/MU6/Th2, Kintor), Elissa (MU9)</p>

    <h3>Played by Tim Durdin</h3>

    <p>Angie (MU7/F6), Korrek (F5)</p>

    <h3>Played by Will Gulland</h3>

    <p>Haram (MU5/F2), Shara (F6)</p>

    <h3>Played by MGA1 (a Mike Abbott, IIRC)</h3>

    <p>Marta (MU3, human)</p>

    <h3>Played by Neil Taylor</h3>

    <p>Harold (MU7/F4, human) with his black cat; Taras (MU7/F3)</p>

    <h3>Played by Karen</h3>

    <p>Umar (Mu5/F3, human) who gained a white Pern dragon in her travels, Jenny
      (F2/M5/Th2/Psi6)</p>

    <p>I'm sure Martin Bonner played in this campaign &#8212; ISTR a Hrulgani fighter,
      their low WIS appealing to his style of play (called Jack?), but can't find
      any character sheets.</p>

    <p>They may not have been very high level (the fighters with artefact weapons
      being the only ones into double figures, and that only after having evened
      out the experience scales so the fighter level breaks were always easier than
      MU ones), but they were quite tough enough. The reason for stopping the
      campaign was the usual that it was getting too powerful, and the systems were
      starting to give under the strain. The free multi-classing was achieved by
      putting xp into the class pot for which it was earned (using a weapon gave
      fighter xp, being sneaky, thief xp, and so on). Thean, the Grey priest,
      joined from a world along the way where such folk did magic, but in a very
      free-form fashion.</p>

    <p>Karen ran a separate, higher level, party that took up the battle vs
      Oktvabrina theme &#8212; Tenar (F10/Mu9/Psi4 &#8212; was a druid imported from Martyn
      Wheeler's game, where hse had picked up both the high-power non-sword weapons
      &#8212; a spear +3 and a scythe +5/prot+5 &#8212; given out for lack of takers, with an
      owl familiar and pet bear), Allecto (MU11, another import, with a familiar
      owl, and a pet sabretooth), Ben (F9/Mu4/psi5, hawk familiar), Alyx(F9/Th7),
      Tarlannon (Mu8), Petra (Mu9/F8 &#8212; who would have been a druid had I been
      running such, with a pseudo-dragon familiar and a sabretooth pet), Jasper
      (F9/Th2).</p>

    <h2>Major Weapons</h2>
