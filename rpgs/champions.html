    <p>Carolyn Wilson &#8212; Height 155cm Weight 54kg Born 23&#8211;Aug&#8211;62 Hair long,
      straight brown Eyes Hazel.</p>

    <p>Her parents' first child, she was born into a conventional middle class
      home of the time, to father Lawrence (b1937), then a junior mananger in a
      London firm, three years on from acquring a nondescript Oxford degree, and
      mother Elizabeth (b1940), who had been a secretary for the same firm, but who
      had given up work after marriage, They lived in a quietly resectable area on
      the Surrey/London border. Despite her father's disappointment that. his child
      was not a boy, she was idolised by her mother, until displaced by her brother
      Martin in the spring of '64.</p>

    <p>The initial feelings of fear and anger turned in time to jealousy, then
      hatred and an abiding resentment, punctuated by occasional attempts at
      unpremeditated fratricide, dismissed as sibling rivalry by her parents
      (though not in those terms) and discouraged by spanking.</p>

    <p>School was her first introduction to the real world. It was 1967, the time
      of Kent state, Apollo 1, Seargeant Pepper. The sheltered environment of play
      with neighbours' children gave way to the tussle of the playground. A tomboy,
      the despair of her mother when coming home cut and bruised, made respectable
      in time for her father's return. He disapproved, spanked her and sent her to
      bed for such rough behaviour. She tried to restore her prestige through work
      &#8212; and was told that girls didn't need to do such things, And too soon,
      Martin's school work was the only one to consider. By the time she came to
      the end of primary school, sexism &#8212; girls were soppy and not to be involved
      in boys games &#8212; came to the playground too, But then, she wasn't interested
      in their football heroes and such, and was tired of them pulling her
      pigtails. But she agreed that girls were by and large, soppy.</p>

    <p>1973, The Moon had been abandoned, Roxy Music, Space Ritual, Nixon and
      Watergate. Carolyn goes to high school, and it's nothing like the books she'd
      read. An all-girls' school, she's glad to be rid of silly boys and their
      trivial preoccuptaions. But then most of the girl talk bores her too. The use
      of needlework and cookery (sorry, Home Economics) classes escapes her. She'd
      learnt all that from her mother years before, like she had leaned to read.</p>

    <p>1975 The Sex Discrimination Act, Carolyn is horrified to realise that such
      things need legislating. And her school goes comprehensive, merging with a
      local boys school, Fights with her mother to be allowed to wear something
      other than the now optional &#8212; hence functionally obsolete &#8212; school uniform.
      Her mother buys her new outfits that she calls pretty, She agrees to wear
      them on condition that she doesn't have to also wear pigtails.</p>

    <p>By this stage, her parents have moved out into the stockbroker belt,
      Lawrence is in a fairly senior position, and Martin is just stating at a
      minor public school. He is going to be a lawyer or doctor or some such. For
      Carolyn, the new school year means the start of O and CSE courses, and boys
      in the classroom again. She stays on the edges of the social groups, her few
      good friends primarily on a 9 to 4 basis.</p>

    <p>Summer 1976, blazing weather. She's at a party given by one of her
      schoolfriends. She hardly knows anyone, feels out of her depth. She's a
      little tipsy on the cheap wine and cider. He's bold with drink, sweaty,
      pimply, boring. His pawing disgusts her and she slaps him. He falls, and his
      friends jeer him for not holding his drink. Trembling with fear and anger,
      she walks home. It's late when she gets home, after a walk of more than ten
      miles. A scene ensues, and she is forbidden parties and forbidden to walk
      home alone at night.</p>

    <p>Instead, she has judo classes, as her parents' second line of defense for
      their daughter's virtue, She is interested in some aspects of the sport, but
      finds it vaguely unsatisfying.</p>

    <p>1978, Good exam results, Her father has no objections to her staying on &#8212;
      the job prospects aren't wonderful, and there's no likelihood of an early
      marriage for her. Carolyn is disappointed &#8212; some of her friends had had to
      fight to stay on. She begins to see politics as something other than the
      howling in Parliament. She joins in the school's Community Help projects
      during activities periods, and encounters feminism that is more than the
      bra-burning Womens Lib that her father dismisses as having achieved what it
      set out to do.</p>

    <p>During the &#8216;Winter of Discontent&#8217;, she helps voluntary groups in deprived
      areas of London. Her parents don't want to condemn this enthusiasm, but think
      it a bit misplaced, After all, there are good works to be done in the
      neighbourhood. There are rows, but her parents know that these are to be
      expected from teenagers.</p>

    <p>One evening, after a swimming gala for the disabled, she is confronted by
      three toughs while walking back to the station. She warns them that she knows
      judo, &#8220;Ha! It's Bruce Lee... This'll be a pushover!&#8221; They tumble, and she
      runs. As she sits, shaking, in the train, she feels that she had been
      fighting more against what she had learned as self defense than against the
      muggers, acutely aware of some obscure frustration.</p>

    <p>1979 &#8220;Boyfriends? What do I need one for? I haven't the time &#8212; and
      besides, they're so boring,&#8221; And, though she doesn't tell her mother, they
      are the enemy. She'll wait until she finds one with whom she has some common
      intellectual ground, and isn't too busy being one of the lads or protecting
      his own ego. An article in one of her mother's magazines replies to a worried
      mother, asking if her sixteen year old son, who hasn't had any girlfriends,
      is gay. Carolyn wonders. But A levels, and university interviews and suchlike
      take up her time.</p>

    <p>1980 History and Politics at UEA. She joins the Aikido group, learning it
      as a martial art with philosophy, not just as a sport or pure self defense.
      Although she dismisses the bulk of it as superstitious rubbish that makes a
      mystery of natural physical capabilities, she feels that there is something
      happening when she focusses whatever it is that they conveniently call 'chi'.
      When sparring, she stands and is heavy, immovable, and yet her gentlest
      strikes will tumble her opponents.</p>

    <p>A pre-Christmas party, the cheap wine tasting like bile. Plastic music and
      few familiar faces. She recognises another fresher she's met at the Women's
      Group. &#8220;Coffee?&#8221; They talk into the small hours, setting the world to rights.
      3am, a look passes. They hesitate. The night is cold outside. They fall
      silent. Their general talk turns to specific action.</p>

    <p>Morning, grey unforgiving winter light. A tangle of limbs resolves into
      two sleepers, reluctant to wake to face the new day, and consider their
      earlier decision and its ramifications.</p>

    <p>1982. As she waits to cross a busy road, Carolyn sees a child dash across
      and stumble. The car can't stop in time. She moves, thinking only &#8220;This is
      going to hurt.&#8221; She lands, empty, in front of the child, and lets the car's
      violence flow past her into the void. &#8220;Don't ever do that again,&#8221; she says to
      the child. &#8220;Are you Wonder Woman?&#8221; he asks. &#8220;We all are!&#8221; she tells him, and
      hurries off. &#8220;She probably was,&#8221; decides the driver, looking at the
      handprints on the bumper. Superfight insurance is still something only the
      Americans do &#8212; his normal policy wouldn't have covered this, had there been
      damage.</p>

    <p>It's in the local paper as &#8220;Wonder Woman saves child&#8221;. &#8220;We need more like
      her&#8221; decide the UEA women's group. Carolyn feels her strained muscles, and
      holds her silence, She doesn't want the notoriety.</p>

    <p>1983 Graduating from UEA with a 2-1 in History and Politics, and a job as
      martial arts and self-defense tutor to a London based Women's Co-operative.
      The pay is mainly bed and board, but that's little different from being a
      student. Being a cooperative, she has to muck in with all the activities, and
      it's rather like an extended holiday. Except that is for the police hassles
      and Nazi punks. The self-defense classes spawn an escort service for women
      out at night, a suggestion by Linda, one of the linchpins of the group, and
      one of Carolyn's first pupils.</p>

    <p>1984 Following a series of abductions, Carolyn goes hunting for the
      perpetrator. She meets up with Mick Fly, an unpleasant seeming bruiser who'd
      been in the news recently [One of the two main super types operting in London
      at the time, Mick was a &#8220;half-brick&#8221; &#8212; a STR 25 flying martial artist with a
      10d6 punch, the other, the leader of the self-styled Watchmen is Doc Savage,
      a clone of the 1930's original]. She feels deep down that one day she'll have
      to fight him and isn't too keen on the idea. She decides on the spur of the
      moment to adopt the name Pushover from old taunts. She had impulsively joined
      the ranks of the long underwear crusaders.</p>

    <p>1984&#8211;1986 Linda and Carolyn become lovers. The Watchmen &#8212; now using the
      name The London Watch at her insistance &#8212; combat too many impersonal and
      irrelevant menaces, and she becomes disillusioned with her abilities as a
      superhero, The long dreaded fight with Mick Fly passes inconclusively. She
      and Linda wish to make a stronger commitment, so she makes a request of Doc,
      which he refuses. She writes in anger</p>

    <blockquote style="clear : both;">
      <p>To&#8212; Dr, J.C. Wildman XVII, ------ Farm, nr Heyford, Oxon<br />
        From&#8212; Ms C. L. Wilson 70 T---------- St. London WC 1</p>

      <p>Re: &#8212; Project H&ouml;nir, Linda and myself</p>

      <p>When I first came to you and suggested you put your talents to a
        worthwhile end, to enable couples otherwise unable to have their own
        children to conceive, I had expected only technical difficuties to
        surmount. From a functional point, what we were asking is no more than the
        Browns asked of Dr. Steptoe &#8212; Louise's birth is now history (she must be at
        school by now), and there are a lot more IVF babies around since then. Nor
        are lesbian couples with children a rarity, whether due to AID, deliberate
        coupling or a previous heterosexual relationship.</p>

      <p>The only unusual thing about the conception and upbringing of our
        daughters would be that despite the pioneering nature of their conception,
        we would not sell our story to the sexist capitalist tabloid press. Since
        this would make their upbringing less remarked upon, this could only help
        to make our intent more acceptable to you. As to how we choose to teach our
        children &#8212; would a doctor refuse IVF to a heterosexual couple on the
        grounds of their religion or politics? Our case differs scarcely in degree
        and not at all in kind.</p>

      <p>As to the technical objections. Firstly, at the risk of being ageist, I
        would remark that you are half again as old as me. Technology has come a
        long way since then. When I was born, transistors were the forefront of
        electronic miniturisation, and the same amount of computing power as I'm
        using to type this letter (the collective's PC:AT) would have filled a
        small house.</p>

      <p>The Nazis, and your prototype may well have surpassed current technology
        in the specific field of human cloning, however, they could not have
        simultaneously invented all the support technology easily available today,
        that could be brought to bear on the problem &#8212; micromanipulation, molecular
        biological techniques such as monoclonal antibodies and gene sequencing,
        automation through microprocessors, image enhancement, amniocentesis,
        freeze-storing of embryos. Specialists could probably name you more.</p>

      <p>We also have another advantage &#8212; we know that cloning can be done, and
        from what I read, that is likely to be the more difficult task, due to the
        effect on the genes of the specialisation of cells in the adult. Linda and
        I would be offering individual halves of genetic material, in a state
        naturally ready to merge and re-arrange. The resulting child would be an
        individual, unlike yourself.</p>

      <p>We would also be able to offer natural wombs for our children. While I'm
        sure the Nazis would have also, I'm not at all sanguine about how they
        might have treated slave mothers &#8212; though I'd guess that once perfected,
        they used a wide-hipped Brunnhilde as your &#8220;brother&#8221;'s mother. Your
        prototype &#8212; using you as an example &#8212; would also have had the separate
        problem of developing an artificial womb. I am sure that many of his
        failures would have occurred at this stage &#8212; exoteric publications have
        shown the height of this art to be the incubation of chicken embryos in
        duck-egg shells. The life-support provided by a placental mammal is far
        more complex than this.</p>

      <p>In the event of a failure, Linda and I are both confirmed supporters of
        a woman's right to control her own fertility. Abortion of a defective
        foetus, while a cause for grief, would not be an insurmountable barrier.
        However, I believe that with the resources at your disposal, and this new
        information, the risks would be far fewer than your prototype faced,</p>

      <p>Yours, Carolyn Wilson</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>[This was before the discovery of sex-link methylation of gene sequences;
      everything else quoted &#8220;from the literature&#8221; was from (then
      still quite respectable) publications such as <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/"><cite>New
          Scientist</cite></a> of the
      time. The idea of creating a child in this manner completely boggled Doc's
      player &#8212; who was quite happy to have a clone as a character, with a
      <cite>Boys from Brazil</cite> type of backstory.]
    </p>

    <p>She resigns in anger from the Watch at Doc's attitude to her desire for a
      child, returning only to recount her fight with the Bugs [Giant wasps from
      Outer Space &#8212; tied up with Mick Fly's origin &#8212; he's a &#8220;lost
      extraterrestrial&#8221; like Kal-El].</p>

    <p>Inevitably, her picture is in the papers. Their friends, neighbours,
      colleagues ask her parents &#8220;Isn't that your daughter?&#8221;. They have to
      reconsider the daughter they almost disowned when she told them she had
      decided that she was a lesbian, and had lost contact with when she left
      college. &#8220;Our daughter, the superhero&#8221; was too tempting to pass up.</p>

    <p>Summer 1986. Carolyn is sunk in depression. Nothing she has attempted
      recently seems to have come to anything. She hangs up her new costume for
      good, leaves a farewell note to Linda, and starts hitching, She makes her way
      north, walking across the wild country. She came at last to the deserted
      coast of Scotland, a lonely abandoned croft with a straggling self-sown
      vegetable garden. She fasts and meditates, eking out her own food with what
      is growing wild. In daylight, she runs though her Tai Chi, at night meditates
      in lotus. On still days, she swims in the sea, No one comes to the valley,
      and she abandons her clothes in the warm weather. She runs through the
      bracken and scrambles up and down the cliffs. Occasionally, she treks into a
      small village or to a nearby farm for supplies, going barefoot. She pounds
      rocks until her hands bleed and are callused and swims the salmon streams
      until she is chilled to the bone and scraped raw. She will bear some of the
      scars for life.</p>

    <p>Somewhere, perhaps in the sea, perhaps in the heather, or on a streambed,
      lies a palm-sized metal mesh, broken and bent. She didn't notice when or
      where it went, and doesn't care. She knows she is in control of her own mind
      [she paid 1ep to buy up her ego defense IIF to be intrinsic power].</p>

    <p>October 1986. She knows she hasn't the resources to overwinter here, she
      is skin and bone and sinew, tanned, bruised and scabbed, hair hacked for
      comfort's sake. She dresses, picks up her pack, and starts for home.</p>

    <p>A little wholefood restaurant in Edinburgh. The staff wonder at the
      barefoot young woman who walks in. She's too coherent to be on drugs or
      booze, but there's a strange intenseness about her all the same, and she has
      to count her money carefully before ordering. She eats as if starved. A
      hundred yards down the road, her shrunken stomach protests at this load. She
      walks to a litter-bin and vomits, then calmly walks on.</p>

    <p>Hitching south brings her to Cambridge, where she sees a poster for a
      Martial Arts tournament in Chelmsford. The eventual winner is Tumbler,
      another fringe member of the Watch, and together with a couple of others on
      the scene, they foil the theft of the takings. She's not sure where she wants
      to go next, so takes up his offer of food and floorspace.</p>

    <p>Two weeks later on the Friday night, they are called to Highgate cemetery,
      and she watches Demon brutally and repeatedly beat a middle-aged woman whom
      he claimed was a known supervillain. Something crawls out of the mediaeval
      plague pit, and Tumbler attacks, while Silver String [a Hawkeye type] goes
      into superstitous hysterics. As if hiding behind Karl Marx' grave would do
      any good, she thinks. The overdramatising hologrammic communicator finally
      manages to come up with someone who's qualified to deal with the problem,
      some super-biochemist with a genetically engineered winged horse. She's too
      tired, too weak, to fight them all. She lays the villain brick over, and then
      fades into the night.</p>

    <p>Where once she thought that something hopeful might come of the Watch, she
      is now totally disillusioned. They are all violent, agressive, hooked on
      patriarchal values. But now where to go? Her parents' home? Back to Linda?
      Odd-jobbing at the Thoth Institute [somewhat like Prof X's school], as
      Tumbler had suggested? What is she going to do with her life? Perhaps to help
      in the Third World?</p>

    <p>Saturday 1&#8211;Nov&#8211;86. Full of futile anger, she fades into the night, her few
      belongings and scant cash are at the circus, so she walks there first, trying
      not to wonder what she will do next. It would be so easy to walk back to the
      Women's Centre, but she could not do that. Her own despair would destroy so
      much of what she had worked there to achieve. And she did not know how she
      could do that to Linda.</p>

    <p>If the hard-won calm of her summer's retreat could be so destroyed in a
      matter of minutes, if her schemes brought nothing but despair after false
      hope was dashed, she could not wish to inflict that on her friends.</p>

    <p>At the caravan, the lock yielded to a firm blow. In the available light,
      she packed her few belongings and what food she could eat without
      preparation, and was gone. She slept where she could find concealment,
      loathing the filth of the city after the wilderness.</p>

    <p>In the morning, bleak and grey, she ached and was chilled. She started to
      walk aimlessly, knowing that in a few days she must do something. Suicide?
      Not yet. Her family? She couldn't tell them what had happened, nor lie to
      them. Hunger forced her to rummage for food in her pack, and in doing so, she
      unearthed White Ninja's letter of introduction to the principal at Thoth UK.
      Now that was a thought. Screwing a living out of those elitist pigs would be
      her revenge. With a more purposeful stride she set off.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Summer&#8221; 1987. After several months, she has finally evolved a <cite>modus
        vivendi</cite>. She has her own room in an otherwise unoccupied wing of the
      Hall, near the gym, with its own fridge and cooker. She teaches basic
      gymnastics through to martial arts, and a few of her pupils have earned her
      respect by bearing up under her severe regime :&#8212;</p>

    <p>&#8220;What I teach is not karate or aikido, and certainly isn't Judo, though it
      has elements of all of them. If you need badges, go to someone who gives
      them. This is what works on the streets.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Between her teaching, she reads or meditates. While her pupils undeniably
      have some special needs, the Institute still reeks of privilege, and she
      feels that she has sold out. She is not yet &#8212; quite &#8212; twenty five, and her
      life is leading her nowhere. She doesn't know how long she can stay in this
      rut, nor where else to go. She feels trapped and weary, not even able to
      motivate herself to rebellion through unconventional dress or hairstyle.</p>

    <p>There has been the usual amount of super-stuff in the papers. Carolyn
      ignores its studiously; the wounds are still there. It was stupid of her to
      ever think she belonged in that world. She had never truly enjoyed it, and
      yet it was somehow addictive. When the expos&eacute; on Lightning made the headlines
      in the tabloids, she dismissed it as a fill-in until the already written
      Fergie's Baby stories can be run. She doesn't know Lightning &#8212; has only seen
      her briefly twice. It would have been nicer to see Mick Fly crucified, rather
      than held up as Britain's answer to Rambo.</p>

    <p>When Alan [Tumbler's secret ID] visits Thoth, he askes whether she would
      be company at dinner. After politely declining the offer twice, no more are
      forthcoming. She is glad &#8212; she had trusted him, until he had joined in the
      violence.</p>

    <p>Saturday 22nd August 1987, late evening. Carolyn's diary.</p>

    <p>Tomorrow is my 25th birthday. What have I achieved so far. Nothing. What
      am I doing? Nothing. If I stay here like this, the MCP bastards will have
      won. &lt;The Pretenders' <cite>Hymn to Her</cite> plays on her casette
      machine. A bottle of cheap red wine stands empty on the desk beside her.
      Chrissie Hynde sings &#8220;Something is lost &#8212; Something is found&#8221;&gt;
      The worm
      must turn. If I don' t do anything, I shall have lost. So I have to fight
      back. How? A new model Pushover in a different rig? The problems are that pig
      Savage, unspeakable Mick Fly, Alan, Demon, all the bloody rest who are
      bigger, tougher, faster, and wrongheaded. Perhaps I'll have a bright idea
      tomorrow.</p>

    <p>Sunday, she wakes late, vaguely hung over. She rereads her diary entry.
      Booze had made her bold, and had pointed out one problem. Other problems
      stood in her way as well &#8212; being strapped for cash was one. She was still
      less mobile than a super needed to be to get to where she might be needed, if
      she could figure out where that was : had she been there she might have had a
      chance of halting that armed maniac the other day [the real-world gun amok in
      Hungerford], but at more risk than most of the other supers she'd met. And
      apart from such oddities, the only other chance for direct action in this
      part of the world was hunt sabotage.</p>

    <p>She cycles into town for supper, treating herself to an Indian, and
      heading home in the dusk and the rain, skids. Tangled in the bike, her
      landing is rough, and she skins the palm of one hand. She visits the sickbay
      for a large plaster, and is offered the results of one of the student's
      experiments, a skin-like dressing that lets light and air to the wound,
      looking nearly transparent from that side, yet being flesh coloured for
      aesthetic purposes, from the other.</p>

    <p>Monday morning's post brings a suprise, an envelope of heavy, parchment
      like paper, airmailed from Perth, W.A. The letter, on notepaper headed
      <cite>Wolf Foundation</cite>, tells her that for her efforts on behalf of
      women's position in society she has been awarded a stipend, half going to
      support the Camden centre, half for her own disposal, with tax being
      administered by the Foundation. Her first installment of the stipend was
      enclosed. Tax free, &#163;10,000 as a banker's draft.
    </p>

    <p>Subsequent monthly installments would cover accomodation expenses, and be
      matched by donations to the Centre or other nominated causes, providing that
      she resumed her career. It was signed J. M. Wolf (Trustee).</p>

    <p>She looked at the postmark. It was dated 14th August. Had someone been
      conditioning her? She looked at the cheque, thought for a while, and decided
      that it more than matched her own price. She picked up the internal phone.
      &#8220;Helo&iuml;se, can you recommend a lawyer?...&#8221;</p>

    <p>She needed somewhere to live, in town, and transport. Immediately, she
      needed leave of absence to find them. She also needed to get back into
      harness. She would have to choose a new appearance for her adventuring, and a
      different name. The latter wasn't so important, but she would need to keep
      her identity hidden from the Watch. She picked at the dressing on her hand,
      and an idea slowly formed.</p>

    <p>In her earlier guise, she had unusual looks full time with her political
      badges, and had a hunted (street gang) rather than the secret ID. Experience
      went on skills, buying down some disads, ego defense and the IR vision. The
      martial arts core power was there from the beginning as a 210 point
      character, and was not increased.</p>

    <h3>Commentary</h3>

    <p>That covers, somewhat tersely, the entire of a campaign that spanned the
      whole real-world 84&#8211;87 span, though she didn't actually do more than one
      outing in her new her ID as Masque. With the coming of the internet, I
      suspect that she got into on-line activity early, especially encryption for
      human rights perhaps becoming the UK's Cypherella.</p>

    <p>Phil's <cite>Kingdom of Champions</cite> supplement for
      <cite>Champions</cite> was based on this campaign. Alas, writing for Hero at
      that time he needed to have characters statted for a later edition of the
      system, a version that mucked around with martial arts and knockback, so I
      said, no, she won't work for that. The character Repulse is the analogue that
      Phil wrote to occupy that niche.

      40 this version currently would be as I write in early '03) version of

    <p>Tessa Roberts was a bright enthusiastic girl from Dalston, who left school
      at 16 because her parents didn't hold with education for girls &#8212; and who
      rebelled by taking a short term of service in the Army, primarily in clerical
      work, but with more than just basic training. After her discharge, she
      answered an advertisment for a PA to Alec Dalton, of Dalton Electronics. Her
      background fitted in nicely with another position he was seeking to fill, so
      she was hired to try out some of the more experimental equipment &#8212; and help
      improve the profile of the company.</p>

    <p>Her driving motivation is to defy the limited expectations her parents had
      of her, and hence denying most of her own background.</p>

    <h3>Commentary</h3>

    <p>A non-nonsense character. Her signature is a 14D6 movethough, doing her
      about 1pt STUN. Got more outings than Carolyn, though being a later start,
      and not being anywhere near so developed as a character. Between being able
      to fly to problems quickly, and not having her own ideas about where she
      wanted to go and what to do with her life, she was much more deployable.
      That's the problem with roleplayed characters &#8212; they do tend to say &#8220;Sod this
      for a game of soldiers&#8221; and bugger off on their own agenda.</p>

    <h2>Patti Miller</h2>

    <p>A late character, developed after Hero Games brough out their mecha RPG,
      <cite>Robot Warriors</cite>, and after <cite>Aliens</cite>. That's the Dalton

    <p>Born 19&#8211;Aug&#8211;52, Height 6', hair long, red. Weight 185lb.</p>

    <p>Always a bright student, she went to MIT to major in engineering in summer
      1970, a conscious decision to avoid the softer subjects. Graduated
      <cite>summa cum laude</cite> 1974. Her interests had gone from civil to
      electronic engineering, and her PhD (Princeton, 1977) was in cybernetics.
    </p>

    <p>Her skills and reputation secured her agood post at one of the
      Northinghouse Corporation research lab. She knew that some way secret
      military wotk was being done on site, and had to curb her inquisitiveness.
      When she finally gave in to temptation, she peeked in a file on her team
      leader's desk. It was the results of a Government requested study on
      super-soldier experiments in 'Nam and after. It wasn't pleasant reading.
      There wre also suggestions of uses for the finished article in corporate
      plans on a named-circulation-only document. She soon became suspicious of the
      uses her own work might be put to and indirectly voiced this concern at work,
      That was when the odd phone calls started, and she soon spotted that she was
      under observation. Jumping before she might be pushed &#8212; or more likely bumped
      off &#8212; she quit, and took a post advancing appropriate technology in Kenya
      (late 1980).</p>

    <p>Five years of this taught her a lot about the hardships of the developing
      world, and gave her time to ponder her career and past research, and
      occasionally, do some guest work at various universities. In late 1984, she
      had an idea, but one that needed finance and backing with a team. England
      would be convenient &#8212; same language &#8212; or near enough &#8212; reasonable
      technological base. It took most of her savings and all 1985 to find the
      person she needed &#8212; Alec Dalton. After initial development, her first
      prototype fusion-powered fibre-composite walker, equipped with materials from
      Dalton's own personal space exploitation programme, is ready for field test
      in 1987.</p>

    <p>Likes and dislikes &#8212; will eat most things &#8212; she had to in Africa, and will
      do so in bravado on encountering those with less robust palates, but much
      prefers what she thinks of as home-style cooking. Drinks beer and bourbon,
      but hasn't really come to terms with Real Ale.</p>

    <h3>Commentary</h3>

    <p>Had the campaign not ground to a halt (bricks were too obviously effective
      compared with other types, and players were dispersed by changing jobs), she
      would have cribbed more tricks from the Nite Owl of the 1970s from
      <cite>Watchmen</cite> &#8212; I was planning the flying owl equivalent as the next
      big purchase when the curtain came down.
