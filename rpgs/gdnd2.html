    <h2>Commentary</h2>

    <p>Mother Night is probably not an attractive choice for players; Lady
      Starbow will gather some women warriors; the Secret Moon is not really a
      player character option, given its secrecy and restrictions; the Blood Moon
      is a relict cult, found only in a few out-of-the-way places and usually
      despised. The Red Magic secrets it teaches are one of the prized posessions
      of the Red Wizards in their mountain lands, rumour of which makes them hated
      and feared beyond what their own efforts can achieve. Mistress Moon is a
      semi-fighting and partly mystic priesthood, suitable for player
      characters.</p>

    <h1>Mother Night</h1>

    <p>One of the nameless spirits of the Dark under the Earth, Mother Night
      first became noted when Thunder Father struck down Emperor Sun from his
      throne at Skytop. As the dying, bleeding Sun fell down the sky into the
      underworld, its inhabitants fled the sudden light. Mother Night led those who
      ascended into the sky, spreading her protecting cloak of darkness over the
      land, as she still does to this day.</p>

    <p>She has only a small following, as she is content to spread her benefits
      to all, each night. Her importance is more mythological and practical than
      spiritual.</p>

    <p><em>Alignment</em>: True Neutral. Priests and worshippers may have any
      alignment.</p>

    <p><em>Minimum Ability Scores</em>: Wis 9</p>

    <p><em>Races allowed</em>: Any, though most common are creatures of the
      underdark.</p>

    <p><em>Proficiencies</em>: Recommended &#8212; Religion, Blind-fighting (no extra
      out-of-class cost).</p>

    <p><em>Duties</em>: Protecting those who are distressed by the raw light of
      the Sun.</p>

    <p><em>Weapons and armour</em>: Chain, shield, any club or similar blunt
      weapon.</p>

    <p><em>Other Limitations</em>: Function at -1 level in natural light, and
      half level (drop fractions) when in direct sunlight.</p>

    <p><em>Spheres</em>: major &#8212; All, Sun(reversed), Protection, Wards, elemental
      fire (reversed); minor &#8212; Healing, Necromantic.</p>

    <p>The reversed form of Summon Fire Elemental summons an elemtal of darkness,
      with similar stats to a Fire elemental, whose attack has the effect of a
      Cause Fear along with regular damage.</p>

    <p><em>Followers and strongholds</em>: As a minor deity, her priests only
      have those followings they can personally attract.</p>

    <p><em>Powers</em>: <em>Darksense</em> (sonar based sense, including
      &#8220;acoustic daylight&#8221;, rather like dolphins); Hide in shadow 50%+5% per level,
      modified by race, armour and Dexterity as thieves; <em>Carpe Noctem</em>:
      Once per level per night, the priest may cause a 10' radius sphere of night's
      darkness around him or herself to become fixed, and endure through the coming
      day. If the priest has cast any spells during the day, one of the priest's
      choice is renewed at sunset.</p>

    <p><em>Symbols</em>: A black disk.</p>

    <h1>Lady Starbow</h1>

    <p>As Emperor Sun fell dying into the underworld, splashes of his burning
      blood fell onto the sky. When even Lord Gloaming, the least and last of the
      sons and retinue of the Emperor, had followed his master beneath the Earth,
      the spiritual nature of these bloodstains quickened them to life. Nurturing
      these last remnants of light came a hitherto nameless and despised sister of
      Lord Gloaming (the Sun having considered the only feminine spirits of worth
      to be the fertile Earth, and then worthy only for their fertility).</p>

    <p>Defending Heaven and Earth against the encroaching Night, she took up the
      great Sky bow her father had let fall, defending each remaining spark until
      the Sun was finally freed from Hell.</p>

    <p><em>Alignment</em>: Neutral Good. Priests and worshippers may have any
      good alignment.</p>

    <p><em>Minimum Ability Scores</em>: Wis 12, Dex 12, Cha 12</p>

    <p><em>Races allowed</em>: Human, elf(except drow), half-elf; only women may
      advance beyond 4th level, and only those who have quested for and won a
      Unicorn mount beyond 8th.</p>

      Religion, Blind-fighting, Tracking. Crossover: Priest, warrior.</p>

    <p><em>Duties</em>: Protecting the weak and oppressed, especially women.</p>

    <p><em>Weapons and armour</em>: Chain, shield, spear, lance, javelin,
      shortbow, short sword.</p>

    <p><em>Other Limitations</em>: Often despised by patriarchal Sun worshippers
      (her worship being most common in areas that revere</p>

    <p>her father and brothers).</p>

    <p><em>Spheres</em>: major &#8212; All, Sun, Protection, Combat, Elemental Fire;
      minor &#8212; Healing, Necromantic.</p>

    <p><em>Special spell</em>: <em>Shooting Star</em>: as the mage spell
      <cite>Flame arrow</cite>, but the spell is cast on the weilder's bow, which
      then transfers the spell's effect onto each arrow fired and lasts until the
      maximum number of arrows have been affected, or one hour has elapsed.
      <em>Detect Silver and Gold</em> (1<sup>st</sup> level)
    </p>

    <p><em>Followers and strongholds</em>: As a minor deity, her priests only
      have those followings they can personally attract.</p>

      May track as a ranger if there are stars visible in the sky if she has the
      Tracking proficiency. At 4th level, if virgin, may quest for a Unicorn mount
      (stats as for a Paladin's war horse). May choose one melee and one missile
      weapon to have Warrior THAC0.</p>

    <p><em>Symbols</em>: A silver bow; a labrys (double bitted axe) &#8212; note that
      this is a weapon that the Starbow priests may not actually use in combat.</p>

    <h1>The Secret Moon</h1>

    <p>Only initiates of her mysteries know any but the barest rumours of her
      past and current actions. She was the barely visible moon only glimpsed in
      the radiance of the Unfallen Sun, and who fled beyond the sky at his fall.</p>

    <p><em>Alignment</em>: True Neutral. Priests and worshippers may have any
      alignment, but usually tend to Lawful Evil.</p>

    <p></p>

    <p><em>Minimum Ability Scores</em>: Wis 13, Cha 13, Dex 15</p>

    <p><em>Races allowed</em>: Any, though usually from outcast populations.</p>

    <p><em>Special spells</em>: <em>Glow</em>: A variant on <cite>Chant</cite>.
      The priest glows with am eerie blue light, which gives him and all his
      associates +1 on all their defensive rolls and -1 to be hit. Lasts 6 rounds,
      plus 1 per level of caster. <em>Summon Secret Moon Elemental</em>: As Summon
      Fire elemental. The elemental is invisible.</p>

    <p><em>Followers and strongholds</em>: As a minor deity, her priests only
      have those followings they can personally attract.</p>

    <p><em>Powers</em>: Gain thief skills as a thief of the same level and the
      benefits of the Assassin kit.</p>

    <p><em>Symbols</em>: A wavy-bladed dagger.</p>

    <h1>The Blood Moon</h1>

    <p>After the first War in Heaven, and the return of the Sun from the Long
      Night, there was at first no moon. How the Moon later arose is not known. She
      may have been the Secret Moon returned, or a once-mortal sorceress who
      attempted to fuse Solar might with the feminine principle, or even a
      synthetic construct built through arcane engineering as an anti-Sun either by
      creatures of Darkness or as a weapon against them. Whatever her origin, the
      presence of a new power enthroned in the sky led to a Second War in Heaven,
      culminating in a battle between the Moon and the Thunder Father from which
      both took sore wounds, and in which the world was shaken and remade.</p>

    <p>The worship of the Blood Moon is a weakened survior into historic time of
      the days before that final war; and is without doubt a debased form of the
      original worship</p>

    <p><em>Alignment</em>: None. Worshippers may have any alignment (but see
      below). The worship of the Blood Moon is often appealing to mages of an
      appropriate mindset.</p>

    <p><em>Minimum Ability Scores</em>: Wis 12 Int 13 Cha 15</p>

    <p><em>Races allowed</em>: Any.</p>

    <p><em>Proficiencies</em>: Required &#8212; Spellcraft, Astronomy, Recommended -
      Religion, Reading/Writing, Ancient Languages, Ancient History, Astrology.
      Crossover: Priest, Wizard</p>

    <p><em>Duties</em>: Spreading the liberating and enlightening message of the
      Blood Moon, if desired.</p>

    <p><em>Weapons and armour</em>: Chain, shield, Sickle, Scimitar, Shortbow,
      Scythe, Rhompia (crescent bladed axe).</p>

    <p><em>Other Limitations</em>: Receive only D6s for hit points; subject to
      the equivalent of <cite>Ravenloft</cite> Power Checks, and hence may often
      sport some malformation (power checks may occur for any essentially selfish
      act): with freedom, such as the liberation from alignment, there comes a
      corresponding responsibility, and those who succumb to temptation wear their
      failures externally. The Blood Moon is also regarded as a demonic figure from
      myth, so her followers also labour under that burden of prejudice, especially
      in areas that were once conquered by, or under threat of conquest by her
      Dominion.</p>

    <p>Casting of priestly spells is affected by the phase of the moon as
      follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Dark of the Moon &#8212; 1st and 2nd only</li>
      <li>Crescent Moon &#8212; up to 4th</li>
      <li>Gibbous Moon &#8212; up to 6th</li>
      <li>Full Moon &#8212; any</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This does not affect casting of wizard spells for split or dual class
      Wizard/Priests.</p>

    <p><em>Spheres</em>: major &#8212; All, Law, Chaos; minor Sun, Charm</p>

    <p><em>Special spells</em>: <em>Moonbeam</em> (Sun 5th), <em>Summon Moon
        Elemental</em>: As <cite>Summon Fire Elemental</cite>. The Moon elemental
      attacks for only half the damage of a Fire elemental, but those attacked must
      save vs Death Magic or make a Madness check.</p>

    <p><em>Followers and strongholds</em>: As a minor deity, her priests only
      have those followings they can personally attract.</p>

    <p><em>Powers</em>: Worshippers may follow any alignment, but its value is
      hidden. Alignment detecting spells yield only "Neutral"; and take no damage
      or other adverse effects from magic items based on their alignment; and gain
      benefits as the better of their own alignment and Neutral. When casting any
      spell, may modify it with metamagic spells (as per Tome of Magic) as
      follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Dark of the Moon &#8212; none</li>
      <li>Crescent Moon &#8212; level totals equal half spell's</li>
      <li>Gibbous moon &#8212; level totals equal to the spell's</li>
      <li>Full Moon &#8212; level totals equal to spell's + 2</li>
    </ul>

    <p>without memorising the metamagic spells or using extra spell slots. If the
      priest is also a wizard, these benefits transfer to casting wizard spells as
      well. Spells so affected glow bright red, even if normally not visible.</p>

    <p><em>Symbols</em>: A half-red, half-black disk.</p>

    <h1>Mistress Moon</h1>

    <p>After the War in Heaven between Thunder Father and the Blood Moon, when
      calm at last returned to Earth and Sky alike, and the clouds that had long
      blocked sight of Sun, Moon and Stars alike parted, a white moon was revealed,
      rolling along the same path as the Sun. Perhaps this was the conquering Blood
      Moon washed clean by the storms, but broken like the Sun before her to wheel
      between Heaven and Underworld.</p>

    <p>Worshippers of Mistress Moon align themselves according to their age into
      the appropriate aspect &#8212; maiden, matron or crone.</p>

    <p><em>Alignment</em>: True Neutral. Priests may have any part-neutral
      alignment. There is no restriction on worshippers.</p>

    <p><em>Minimum Ability Scores</em>: Wis 10, Cha 12</p>

    <p><em>Weapons and armour</em>: Chain, shield, Sickle, Scimitar, Shortbow,
      Scythe, Rhompia (crescent bladed axe).</p>

    <p><em>Other Limitations</em>: The secretive and nocturnal nature of their
      worship can cause a negative reaction from non-worshippers.</p>

    <p><em>Spheres</em>: major &#8212; All, Charm, Divination, Summoning, Sun; minor -
      Elemental, Healing (and Necromantic if you use the unrevised spell
      spheres).</p>

    <p><em>Followers and strongholds</em>: As a minor deity, her priests only
      have those followings they can personally attract.</p>

    <p><em>Powers</em>: A priestess of the moon as maiden has
      <em>Charm/Fascination</em>; a priestess of the moon as matron has
      <em>Soothing Word</em>; a priestess of the moon as crone has <em>Turn
        Undead</em>. Saves against any of their magical effects are at -1 during the
      appropriate phase of the moon.
    </p>

    <p>At 5th Level, all gain <cite>Inspire Fear</cite> (as per the
      <cite>CPHB</cite>).
    </p>

      high level undead, results in the character's death rather than
      transformation into undead.</p>
