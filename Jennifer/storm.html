    <h1>The Storm</h1>
  </div>
  <div id="upperblaze" class="rose">&nbsp;</div>
  <div id="content">
    <p>It was early afternoon, on a cloudy day in late spring, the sky showing
      bright blue through the gaps between the rows of heavy cumulus clouds, and
      occasionally, even the sun shone through to bring a brief cheer to the day. A
      wind blew fitfully, and chill, moving clouds of dust, and torn scraps of
      paper, such litter as there ever was these days.</p>

    <p>Few people were abroad, women shopping, their children with them, or men
      alone, tramping wearily about the streets. There were no young men &#8212; they
      were generally waiting for the night, for violence that was their only life,
      those of them who could not, or would not, adapt to the rapid changes in
      life-style that had come upon them. Only the children seemed not to share in
      the general feeling of despair, too young yet to understand the pall that lay
      over their parents' lives.</p>

    <p>One among them stood out for her radiance, as if some hidden flame burned
      within her, casting a brightness around her that lasted even while the sun
      was hidden. She walked amongst the everyday people as if she did not see
      them. And indeed, that was essentially the truth, for she walked without
      concentrating on the walking, her eyes not connected to her conscious
      perceptions.</p>

    <p>She was young, and beautiful, and that also would set her apart from the
      rest, as would more subtle marks, down to the pale streak in her honey-gold
      hair, her perfect teeth, her immortality.</p>

    <p>As one knowing herself above and apart from the common host, Jennifer
      Benchley, a self-made immortal, and witch, moved down the High Street in
      Chesterton, enjoying her existence, her perfect body. And yet there were
      flaws in her being subtler yet; the sure knowledge that her identity was
      something fragile erected over something ultimately vile. Soon she would have
      to commence a work nigh as great as that that she had so recently
      accomplished, a work that would be a partial suicide, a removal of that Other
      personality that belonged to her being.</p>

    <p>And yet&#8230; Already she felt the weight of years hang heavy upon her. In
      this automated society, to live on forever would not go unnoticed. Even
      allowing her husk a semblance of age would only work for a century, and while
      it was feasible that science might develop its own methods of immortality
      before then, she would still be one to be remarked on for being a nobody; for
      surely such treatment would only ever be given to the great and important, to
      avoid drowning the world in human flesh that more quickly.</p>

    <p>And a hundred years would be no time for an immortal. Jennifer shuddered
      slightly as she considered the true meaning of what she had won for herself,
      a one-way weary ticket non-stop to the end of time. To see the stars all
      across the universe gutter and die, perhaps be scavenged by the super
      civilizations of the day and be poured down black holes for power, until only
      those emptinesses and the last handful of inhabited worldlets existed, slowly
      dying, and she, at last forced to become a disembodied spirit wandering the
      darkness.</p>

    <p>Alone.</p>

    <p>Or perhaps&hellip; There were billions of years yet in which she might
      find companionship. She smiled wryly to herself and returned to reality,
      found herself walking down a side street of slightly shabby houses, and a
      couple of pubs which backed onto the river. Between them, a bridge spanned
      the steel grey flow, and she crossed onto the open greenness of Stourbridge
      Common. A man on a bicycle, wearing a blue donkey jacket, and cap, passed her
      and crossed the bridge, but apart from that there was no one to be seen.</p>

    <p>There never was, she reflected, as she turned to walk along the riverside
      path, save on the sunniest days &#8212; or perhaps at the weekends &#8212; she had only
      ever come here on weekdays. A half a mile away, the railway crossed the
      river, and at that end of the common, cattle and a few horses grazed.</p>

    <p>The sun, of a sudden, stood revealed, giving its warmth and brightness to
      a world turned grey, and even the wind became a gentler if not weaker,
      thing.</p>

    <p>A feeling came to her then of the cycle of life, the living, breathing,
      pulsing of the Earth, of continual death and rebirth, a feeling of power and
      continuity, brought to her by some witchsense subtler than sight. And a
      feeling of separation, of being outside that bustle of activity.</p>

    <p>A drop of rain fell upon her face, and then another, and another while the
      sun still shone. It poured heavily, the silver of the rain touched to gold by
      sunlight, drenching her coat, soaking it through in a few moments, then
      ceasing as suddenly as it had come.</p>

    <p>The ground steamed faintly in the warmth of the sun, warming even the
      chill of Jennifer's damp garments, though she would have preferred to discard
      them, and run naked on the grass, in the sun, and perhaps the&#8230;</p>

    <p>Rain. It had taken a little while for the true meaning of what had just
      happened sink through to her. After the ritual that had broken her free from
      her flesh, not fifteen hours before, she had been left with the embarrassment
      of having her previous disfigured body to dispose of, and with no better
      means to hand, had set it in a circle of concealment, and lain a curse of
      corruption upon it, at the foot of the Castle hill, behind the back wall of a
      garage and a power transformer, with the intention leaving until it rotted to
      the more easily disposable bones. But rain now would wash away the powder
      that marked out the circle, leaving her corpse open to any eyes. She prayed
      that her luck hold, and that the usually deserted hill remained deserted
      during the hours of daylight. And then in the dead of night, she would have
      to do what she had considered impossible the pervious night &#8212; dispose of the
      body.</p>

    <p>But how? she asked herself as she turned back, to slowly retrace her
      homewards way. Fire, the obvious method, was blocked to her, for her entire
      supply of incendiary had been consumed by accident the night before, and it
      would be weeks before it would be possible to perform the rituals to enchant
      more.</p>

    <p>Burial? it was a possibility worth thinking of &#8212; cover the site with the
      turves, and scatter the surplus dirt on the slopes, with a slightly more
      permanent spell of concealment to blur the details of the operation. That
      would mean lot of hard work, and the acquisition of a spade. There was one in
      the shed of the garden at home &#8212; had to be &#8212; for the entire back plot was
      used as a vegetable plot.</p>

    <p>Well, that settled the matter. Now it only remained to set up the
      enchantment that would be needed to conceal her grave. And then the rain
      might well be of use to her, clearing people from the evening streets.</p>

    <p>But it would be hard work, and there would be the awkwardness of carrying
      a spade there and back, and if it rained, it would be extremely
      uncomfortable, but there was little else she could do.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Home. Her first action on returning was to push a hasty note into the slot
      by the bell pushes cancelling all her appointments as a witch for the day,
      giving family business as a pretext.</p>

    <p>Back, at last, in her room, she locked the door, and threw off her damp
      clothes, glad for a chance to towel herself down, and make a pot of tea. And
      then, to work, to decide what she would need, and when.</p>

    <p>She returned to her bedroom, and turned on the television, keying the
      viewdata weather forecast for the area. It was good &#8212; rain from eight to
      midnight was the forecast, possibly with thundery outbreaks.</p>

    <p>So&#8230; Lightning would be as effective as fire, if she were to focus the
      vast powers of a storm into cremating her old body, and that would make
      everything a lot more moveable. With increased enthusiasm for hem task, she
      returned to the study, seeking her tome on weather lore, and certain items of
      her equipment, as well as the items she had already sought.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Evening came, and the rain with it, heavy and constant, drumming down onto
      the dry earth, its noise so steady as to become unheard.</p>

    <p>Jennifer waited an impatient half hour, so that the storm would be at its
      height when she arrived at the Castle hill, and then walked out into the
      steady downpour. The rain drenched her almost instantly, making her glad that
      she had chosen to wear only jeans and a T-shirt, and poured down her face in
      steady stream. She ran down the unlit streets, the sounds of her passage lost
      in the rain, and her figure lost in a gloom only slightly relieved by sky
      glow and the occasional, weak, street light.</p>

    <p>Instinctively, she retraced the route she had taken the previous night,
      out to the open spaces that flanked the river throughout this town, along
      what was the nearest there came to a straight line between where she lived,
      and where, in a sense, she had died.</p>

    <p>The lightning began as she crossed the river, a faint and distant stroke,
      visible only in the dimness of the light, at a distance unguessable, the
      sound of the thunder lost in the rain. Slower then, not because her new body
      laboured, but because the going was heavy, water already gathered in puddles
      upon ground that had been parched for a few weeks, turning the surface to a
      slippery mire, she crossed the openness, carrier-bag swinging wildly from one
      hand, and an oaken wand in the other, which pulsed with the power of the
      storm.</p>

    <p>She crossed the road, and began to head towards the bridge across Jesus
      weir, when she noticed a blue light flashing ahead of her. Police. Jennifer
      froze, feeling as if a trap were shutting tight about her, knowing that she
      should have taken the longer way around, north of the river, along the main
      roads, the way that she had walked home the day before.</p>

    <p>But now she was here, there was still a route she could take without
      passing over that bridge. Instead of veering right, towards the river, she
      followed the stagnant ditch that marked the border of Jesus College, along
      another of the paths that crossed the green.</p>

    <p>Even so, she did not make the journey undiscovered. About half of the way
      there, she heard something ahead of her, caught a glimpse of movement through
      the rain and unlit dark. A policeman, with his radio on. Alone, she hoped, as
      she lifted up the medallion she wore, that was now her only protection
      against interruption.</p>

    <p>The symbols graved on it glowed faintly blue as she held it forth, their
      wan light showing the man's face.</p>

    <p>&#8220;There is no one here,&#8221; she whispered, &#8220;only the rain. You cannot see me
      for it, there is only my voice, but you will forget even that when I cease to
      speak. You will continue your patrol, as if all this had never even
      happened.&#8221;</p>

    <p>As she spoke, she edged sideways off the path, and squatted down, waiting
      for him to pass, holding the medallion up until the light no longer showed
      him.</p>

    <p>Only then did she move again, returning to the surer footing of the path,
      sprinting for the comparative shelter of the narrow streets that made the
      fourth border of he green and she was glad when she gained them. She was
      shaken by the police presence, annoyed at herself for not even thinking to
      check on the progress they had made at discovering the person responsible for
      two police murders.</p>

    <p>Fighting down her fear, she continued into the tangled streets, working
      diagonally through them to emerge on the main road close to the river, and
      Magdalene bridge. She blinked in the sudden light, and then continued,
      between the two halves of Magdalene College, separated by a road that was
      overhung in places by Tudor frontage. There were people here, students, all
      dashing from shelter to shelter, oblivious of her as she passed, and cars
      that hissed in the rain-sluiced street as they passed.</p>

    <p>The lightning was closer now, the sound of thunder giving it a distance of
      only a mile or so, and bright enough to show colour in its flashes.</p>

    <p>Nearly there, she thought, as she crossed the road at the traffic lights,
      rejoining the path she had taken the night before, taking the climb easily in
      her supernal body, without slackening pace, and then, she could duck out of
      sight of the road, and she was there, and thankfully, alone. The discarded
      corpse that she had left there was visible as a whiteness in the gloom and
      clearly whenever the lightning flashed.</p>

    <p>Jennifer hurried to stand by her corruptible form, and looked it over in
      disgust, at the scars that she had borne, and at the decay that had set in at
      her command. Then she ignored it as she set up a small circle of talismans,
      driving them deep into the earth with the blade of the trowel she had
      brought, and then, within the circle she discarded her hampering garments
      onto the ground, and bearing the oaken wand, spoke the words that would give
      her mastery over the lightning.</p>

    <p>Blue fires played off the wand as she spoke, and ran down her perfect form
      in rivers. Tension gathered in the air, and remained for an instant that was
      stretched with pregnancy, before a howling shaft of light burst into
      existence linking cloud and ground, and was gone. The thunder was loud enough
      to no longer be a sound, just a wave of stunning force that nigh knocked her
      from her feet, and left her head ringing but Jennifer remained unmoved,
      continued the chant, and poured another of those immense discharges into the
      riven form at her feet. She paused to examine her work then aware that each
      of the bolts she had unleashed had contained the entire lightning release of
      the storm for the duration of their conjuring, an unthinkably large amount of
      energy, focused onto one small target.</p>

    <p>And they had accomplished their task. Instead of the pallor of flesh,
      there was only bone and ash at her feet, ash that would be washed away in the
      rain, bone that she could remove, that would be most useful, even in its
      par-calcined state.</p>

    <p>She bent to collect the larger bones, and bag them together, and then
      paused in mid motion. It took a second or so for her to realize what it was
      that she had noticed, which was nothing &#8212; the stilling of the wind and the
      rain, the ceasing of the lightning. She began to rise, warily, struck with
      sudden terror, before regaining a grip on herself. Nonetheless, she looked
      carefully around, holding tight onto her wand that she might loose power at
      any watcher.</p>

    <p>And it was well that she did. Only an instant passed and the hair on her
      neck began to rise, and in a familiar stench of ionization another hungry
      bolt of lightning reached down. Instinctively, Jennifer fielded the blast,
      letting it splash towards other, more suitable paths to the earth. Then, as
      if at a signal, the wind and the rain commenced afresh, like a wild beast.</p>

    <p>The rain that had been heavy now was hurled down like hail, stinging her
      bare flesh and chilling her through, while the wild wind tried to scrape her
      from the hillside. Desperately, she turned to face the wind as it blew from
      the south, holding her wand out in the hope that some of its virtu might
      weaken the icy blast.</p>

    <p>And icy it was, for as the seconds passed, the temperature plummeted, the
      rain becoming a driving snowfall that began to build up against her faster
      than it would melt.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Show yourself,&#8221; she cried into the wind, invoking binding words that
      would compel any sylph to her will, certain that her attempt to control the
      storm had angered one of those subtle spirits, but there was no abating of
      the unnatural storm. Lightning came again, but this stroke she let bounce
      back to its source, somewhere beyond sight in the wild skies.</p>

    <p>That at last provoke reaction, a redoubling of the assault. The air now
      tore her nose and throat with its cold and she could not feel the frozen
      flesh where snow piled up, and was blown away again. She was sure now that
      her body ought already to have died in thermal shock, and was continually
      being renewed from her newly acquired immortality, but at a rate that might,
      all the same, overwhelm her, force her to discarnate, and become vulnerable
      to the darkness within her.</p>

    <p>Then, slowly, the wind and snow began to slacken, then faster, until as
      fast as it had come, the fierce winds were again still, and in a nearly clear
      sky, the full moon shone bright upon the snow.</p>

    <p>Ragged, the remains of the storm clouds were blowing briskly across the
      steely grey vault of the sky. The wind that blew fitfully seemed balmy,
      almost hot, by contrast. There was no sound, but that of far-away traffic.</p>

    <p>Jennifer picked herself up, shedding great masses of snow, and looked
      around her. In her slipstream, no snow had settled, and her clothes remained,
      frozen, she suspected, to the round. A few meters beyond, her skull lay
      lopsidedly, looking up the hill. And in front of her stood a human shape,
      hidden by darkness to the normal eye, but clear in the witchsight, natural to
      her new form and outlined by a strange aura.</p>

    <p>&#8220;You lived!&#8221; the other, a man, spoke, and stepped from shadow into the
      moonlight. He was about Jennifer age &#8212; maybe a couple of years one way or the
      other &#8212; and untidy, but there was a hint of something strange in his eyes,
      and an unmistakable tone of joy in his voice. &#8220;Another one. How long&hellip;
      how long have you been a storm&hellip; stormrider.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;My story's not that simple. I&#8230; Were you the storm?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;No &#8212; but I was up there &#8212; something hurt me and I kicked back, burned out
      the storm &#8212; landed here, to see what happened. You?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I called the lightning to destroy a body. My own body, the one I used
      before I grew this one. It's one of the problems of being an immortal.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Did he believe her? Jennifer could not tell. His story was reasonable,
      explaining the lightning colours in his aura. She felt very vulnerable &#8212; with
      the skull still surviving, to be identified, she was still legally dead, and
      likely to be accused of her own murder to boot.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I oughtn't believe you,&#8221; he said after a short pause, &#8220;but your story is
      as crazy as mine. And I'd sure like a try at your immortality. I'm Craig
      Allen. Care for hot drink?#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Will do. Just let me get dressed again.&#8221;</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Coffee was welcome after that ordeal, its effect more psychological than
      actual, as it warmed hands and body. Indeed the room was hotter than usual,
      the fire on to dry Jennifer's clothes, while she sat deep in an armchair,
      wrapped in a heavy dressing-gown, and she revelled in the warmth like a
      cat</p>

    <hr class="bar" />

    <p>This is a late fragment, but I'm not sure where this was going. If it
      weren't for the last paragraph, it might stand alone as a vignette. Like the
      last story was <cite>Don't Fear the Reaper</cite>, this one was a later B&Ouml;C
      track, <cite>I am the Storm</cite>, but that was about as far as it took me.
      And this gives a <i>terminus post quem</i> of around 1980.</p>

    <p>By the mid 80s, I had a very rough outline for the next real episode,
      <cite>Millenium Night</cite>.
    </p>

    <p>After going abroad for most of the 90s, as an extended <i>wanderjahr</i> to
      escape the dystopian regime (of whatever complexion). This return would be
      in order to see the eclipse in Cornwall, and would involve a side-trip to
      Tintagel, where something occult and Arthurian would take place, leaving her
      in possession of Excalibur.</p>

    <p>Fast forward to late December '99. She drives in her electric car from
      Dover (having taken the Chunnel) A2, M25, M11, along roads barely ploughed
      clear of deep snow (remember, we were being promised an Ice Age just around
      the corner during the 70s), under massed sodium lights and
      an angry red sky. While people are partying like it's 1999, all sorts of
      mystic shit hits the fan &#8212; Jack o'the Greens, fey folk, dryads, chalk figures
      &#8212; and Jennifer has to do something involving Excalibur and the Rex Futurus.
      The fact that the the man now next (updated Spring 2023!) in line for the throne is William
      <em>Arthur</em> Phillip Louis of the House of Windsor might have been
      significant.

    <p>Alas, there are not enough details to tell this tale (what happens at
      Tintagel, the nature of the Y2K crisis); and the fact that it is in a
      significantly diverged time-line doesn't help</p>

    <p>The idea then was to skip further and further into deep time, possibly
      into the <a href="../MovingDay/index.html" title="Nancy is the protagonist of my SF novella and its sequels">Nancy
        Wolf</a> future history, and beyond into the truly weird. But I never
      got as far as getting anywhere near being caught into the trap of trying to describe the
      Transcend/Singularity.</p>

    <p>How does the cosmos work with devils and such? &#8212; as well as the DC/Vertigo
      setting does. I could say that in some fashion they are imprints in the Dust
      (as in Egan's <cite>Permutation City</cite>) who can interact with us, as the
      folk of the city could with the Autoverse; and that in Deep Time, downloading
      into the Dust would be the way out of the heat death of the positronium era
      and beyond.</p>
