<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The characters from <cite>Neon Genesis Evangelion</cite> are played
straight as seen &#8212; their universe is the baseline for <cite>Neon Angelic
Genesis</cite>; this page introduces the characters who have been merged in
from a separate continuity, and thus been to an extent re-written. If you
need <a href="http://www.lwhy.clara.net/nge/">a guide to the NGE characters</a>, then you
probably won't understand the first thing that's going on here&#8230;</p>

<p>Plus, there is one ringer, gathering together another interloper
into the Evangelion world in my first Eva fic, <cite>Redemption-E</cite>.</p>

<h3>Warning</h3>

<p><strong>There are some potential spoilers here, for the original titles
(<cite>Angelic Layer</cite>, <cite>Magic Knight Rayearth II</cite> and 
<cite>Chobits</cite>), as well as <cite>Neon Angelic Genesis</cite>.</strong></p>

<h3>The (extended) cast in order of appearance.</h3>
</div>

<div class="floatleft">
<h2>Dr. Ichiro &#8220;Icchan&#8221; Mihara</h2>
<img height="372" width="115" src="ichiro.jpg" alt="" title="" />

<p>Age:&nbsp;30</p>

<p>Occupation:&nbsp;Chief&nbsp;of Cybernetics R&amp;D for NERV</p>

<p>In the <cite>Neon Angelic Genesis</cite> world, there was no scope for an
eccentric designer of exotic playthings. Instead of developing the technology
that led to various forms of cybernetic toy, culminating in the battle dolls
of <cite>Angelic Layer</cite>, he was recruited into NERV by Ritsuko Akagi,
who had known him as a fellow student at Tokyo-2 University, where he had
been a student of Dr. Shuuko Suzuhara.</p>

<p>The straitened circumstances did not serve to significantly alter his
inventiveness or his eccentric sense of humour. While the physical technology
did not permit the development of angel dolls in the early 2010s, his on-line
collaboration with his former supervisor led to the release of the somewhat
similar, purely virtual network game, <cite>Spirit Warriors</cite>, in 2012,
by a small start-up based in the US.</p>
</div>

<div class="floatleft">
<h2>Elda<br />[&#12456;&#12523;&#12480;]</h2>
<img height="202" width="140" src="elda.jpg" alt="" title="" />

<p>Age:&nbsp;6&nbsp;months (when first seen)</p>

<p>Occupation:&nbsp;Personal Digital Assistant</p>

<p>Once given access to the bio-computing technology used by Naoko Akagi to
produce partials of herself in the MAGI, and the biological engineering used
to craft the Evangelions, Dr. Mihara was finally able to produce a physical
creation, the daughter of his mind, if not of his body.</p>

<p>Her psychology is, inevitably, similar to that of the parallel persocom
later known as Chi.</p>
</div>


<div class="floatleft">
<h2>Misaki Suzuhara</h2>
<img height="209" width="154" src="misaki.jpg" alt="" title="" />

<p>Age:&nbsp;14</p>

<p>Occupation:&nbsp;Student and Evangelion pilot</p>

<p>Misaki is a tough, resourceful young woman, who seems to have managed to
overcome the separate traumata of growing up after the Second Impact, the
death of her father at a young age, and being placed into the foster care of
her grandparents (when her mother, Shuuko, could, for various personal
reasons, no longer handle her upbringing), and later her youngest aunt.</p>

<p>The only Evangelion pilot to have lost a father, rather than a mother, she
becomes an unwitting wild-card in the team that SEELE, through Gendo Ikari,
have assembled to achieve their Human Instrumentality Program.</p>

<p>A couple of years older than as seen in <cite>Angelic Layer</cite>, and
tempered by the vicissitudes of her early life, she has modelled herself on
the same iconic character that inspired her prototype's angel, and has matured into
someone with the same sort of strength of character and self-possession as
Hikaru Shido, Pillar of Cephiro-<span class="notnn4">&#8203;</span>that-<span class="notnn4">&#8203;</span>was.</p>
</div>

<div class="floatleft">
<h2>Aunt Shouko</h2>
<img height="252" width="160" src="shouko.jpg" alt="" title="" />

<p>Age:&nbsp;28</p>

<p>Occupation:&nbsp;TV&nbsp;current affairs journalist in Tokyo-3 and
foster-parent to her niece Misaki</p>

<p>Has a cameo in the <cite>Sickness 
Unto Death, And&#8230;</cite> equivalent (Part 4/<a href="misaki-4.html"><cite>In 
the Ocean of Being</cite></a>).</p>
</div>

<div class="floatleft">
<h2>Chitose Hibiya</h2>
<img height="246" width="183" src="chitose.jpg" alt="" title="" />

<p>Age:&nbsp;19&nbsp;(in&nbsp;2005)</p>

<p>Occupation:&nbsp;Student at Tokyo-2 university (in 2005)</p>

<p>Later to become Ichiro's wife, she only has a cameo in the <cite>Birth of
NERV</cite> flash-back (Part 8/<a href="misaki-8.html"><cite>The Shattered 
Tower</cite></a>).</p>
</div>

<div class="floatleft">
<h2>Freya<br />[&#12501;&#12524;&#12452;&#12516;]</h2>
<img height="376" width="164" src="freya.jpg" alt="" title="" />

<p>Age:&nbsp;2&nbsp;months (when first seen)</p>

<p>Occupation:&nbsp;Personal Digital Assistant, and heir to Dr. Mihara.</p>

<p>In this world, Icchan gave this name to his second Chobit/<span class="notnn4">&#8203;</span>Persocom, and
used this different styling (as seen in the crafting of the security persocom
named Dita in the <cite>Angelic Layer</cite>/<span class="notnn4">&#8203;</span><cite>Chobits</cite>
parallel).</p>
</div>

<div class="floatleft">
<h2>Kitsune<br />[Nancy Elanor,<br />Lady Wolf]</h2>
<a href="../MovingDay/index.html">
<img height="100" width="125" src="nancy-char1.jpg" 
alt="Nancy Wolf and a small part of Castle Wolf in the background" 
title="Nancy Wolf and part of Castle Wolf" />
</a>

<p>Age:&nbsp;98 (proper time, in Earth standard years)</p>

<p>Occupation:&nbsp;Making the best of all possible worlds</p>

<p>A visitor from the 34<sup>th</sup> century of an alternate 
future.  Part of a hive/clan of emortal, genetically engineered, post-<span class="notnn4">&#8203;</span>human
clones, self-<span class="notnn4">&#8203;</span>exiled after memetic poisoning, and recruited by the Powers of
Earth &#8212; who may have contrived her, via subtle effects
hidden within the genetic upgrades supplied for the creation and upgrade of 
each new generation &#8212; to help bring about an orderly Singularity
by returning to the past, before the actual messy event.</p> 

<p>With such a mission brief, she acts as the new factor in my 
first alternate Eva story, <a 
href="../authority/eva.html"><cite>Redemption-E</cite></a>.</p>
