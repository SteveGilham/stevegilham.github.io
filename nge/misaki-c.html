<p>[<em>Intro track &#8212; <a href="samples/op-26.mp3"><cite>The Hammer</cite></a> : Mot&ouml;rhead</em>]</p>

<p>[<em>Incidental music &#8212; <a href="samples/in-26-1.mp3"><cite>Tundra</cite></a>, then <a href="samples/in-26-2.mp3"><cite>Cerulean</cite></a> :
John Adams; then <a href="samples/in-26-3.mp3"><cite>Heliopolis</cite></a> : Banco de Gaia</em>]</p>

<p>We look up to the sky, full of smoke and the roiling clouds born of the
firestorm, while Misaki/Yui looks to the Earth below.</p>

<p>Something is coming.</p>

<p>Something big.</p>

<p>As above, so below.</p>

<p>On the scarred plain of battle, where only the carrion birds remain to
show that there is other life still surviving, the two Evangelions are all
that we have left to contest the endgame. All merely human agency &#8212; and much
that was beyond human &#8212; is spent. There is some radio chatter from the JSSDF
remnants, and no doubt in their bunkers, politicians are wondering what else
to unleash. But if the other NERV branches who supplied the new, fallen,
Evangelions had the ear of those with fingers on the nuclear button, I think
we would have seen the evidence by now.</p>

<p>There is a rippling of the cloud layer, as something descends from the
Lunar Realm, something cast aside, to return, transmuted. We can feel it, the
Light of which our enemies' devices were mere reflections. A thrusting spear
no longer.</p>

<p>A chalice, brimming with, overflowing with, fire and with water.</p>

<p>Its very presence banishes the false images made in its absence.</p>

<p>The Grail descends to Earth, and is caught by a white figure that rises
from under our feet. Lilith/Rei.</p>

<p>I see now why she was manufactured &#8212; one free of certain human taints,
halfway to the Angels already, destined to to play the part of its keeper.
And I think that I too was part of such a grander construction, chosen &#8212; even
conceived &#8212; to be the Knight.</p>

<p>But I think that things have taken a course not foreseen.</p>

<p>It is not that there will be no final struggle, or alchymic marriage, but
I have a gut feeling that the Commander's plans, NERV's plans &#8212; which I am
certain were very different from each other, have been derailed. There are
three here, not two.</p>

<p>The decision is ours. We may duel for the Bride, or&#8230;</p>

<p>I hold out my hands, one to each of the others. Let the conflict be over.
It has gone on for long enough, and I am tired to my heart of it.</p>

<p>Rei, the first and last of the Angels, alpha and omega, smiles shyly.
Misaki's armoured visage is inscrutable, but she too extends her arms. We are
clasped in a ring around the Grail.</p>

<p>And we dance, like the three Graces.</p>

<p>As we circle, I can feel the change begin. The old world is over. It time
for the players to remove their masks.</p>

<p>I step forth from my carapace, and I am clad all in red, for I am Woman
active, unfettered, her own Mistress throughout. On my right hand, a dancer
in blue, Woman nurturing and supportive. And on my left, veiled in white,
Woman who carries Wisdom. Vulgarly, Maid, Mother and Crone.</p>

<p>There is no distinction now between that which was Asuka and that which
was Kyoko, any more than there was between Asuka the student engaged in her
studies, and Asuka the player of games. We are just aspects of a larger
self.</p>

<p>And the larger self grows.</p>

<p>No matter where you go, everyone's connected.</p>

<p>Each is an aspect of the whole, and yet I can see each from the outside. I
see Misaki, her will like a pillar of flame, that gives us all strength. And
Shinji, quietened in sleep. Misato, fallen from her motorbike, her blood
staining the ground she lies on. I kneel down beside her and place a hand
upon her brow. She shudders, but her face becomes peaceful, and her breathing
eases. There is Maya, cowering under her desk, but bravely trying to hold
things together. She asks &#8220;Did&#8230; Did we do the right thing?&#8221;, and though I
cannot give any definite answer, I give her comfort with my presence. Down,
far below, there is Gendo Ikari, waiting for death, hoping for oblivion, who
regards me with disinterest, for I am not whom he had anticipated. There are
the SEELE cabal, each cowering in their own fastness, and I fill them with
dread by my very presence, for they are still alive.</p>

<p>In every home, in every street, every village, every city, in the heights,
the wilds, the air, upon the deeps, we are all I.</p>

<p>The world dissolves, the dance is all.</p>
<hr />

<p>[<em>Suddenly, silence, apart from ragged breathing.</em>]</p>
<p>And in the centre, in the still point, am i.</p>

<p>Just the little self.</p>

<p>Pilot Asuka Langley Soryu, sitting in a tube full of LCL, awaiting the end
of the world that she managed to stave off for a little while, a last respite
before the world dissolves into ambiguity, with a last final sigh, all
meaning lost.</p>

<p>And i realise that this is the Gate of which Kaworu spoke.</p>

<p>The choice is mine.</p>

<p>The weight of the world is upon me. And who am i to choose &#8212; this girl
with a childhood that never let her be a child, that she would rather erase
completely from recollection? In this moment of clarity, i can see my faults
and list them dispassionately &#8212; hard, unforgiving, unsympathetic, driven to
shoring up this ramshackle fa&ccedil;ade of self.</p>

<p>The office is simply a happenstance, an accident &#8212; i am simply the one in
the right place at the right time, the one who drew the short straw.</p>

<p>A voice speaks quietly in my ear.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is not the end. Everything that wills, may return to life.</p>

<p>&#8220;All the futures are there before us, all the pasts redeemed in the Omega
Point.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then i hear Ayanami speaking : &#8220;What do you wish for?&#8221;, she asks.</p>

<p>And in the moment, i am free of desire. Yet there should be something more
than just mere existence, better than the well-meaning hapless folk &#8212; but i
am, whatever my inheritance, still only human, and too limited to conceive a
paradise in its entirety.</p>

<p>In my hands, i have the Cure for the World's Pain &#8212; and i lack the art to
make use of it.</p>

<p>Who can i turn to?</p>

<p>They appear to me, each in their turn.</p>

<p>Shinji &#8212; &#8220;Scarlet woman &#8212; you just delighted in prick-teasing, flaunting
yourself at me, but withholding yourself. I'm glad you went away. Don't
bother me now.&#8221;</p>

<p>It wasn't like that. I said we shouldn't share such close accommodation at
our age. I can't help your hormones.</p>

<p>Misato &#8212; &#8220;A proper little madam. That's what you were. High time you acted
your age, you spoilt little brat.&#8221;</p>

<p>What age was I supposed to be? Four going on twenty-four was a good
average.</p>

<p>Misaki &#8212; &#8220;You were damaged. I showed you the way to heal. But you have to
do the hard parts by yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>For that I am grateful, but I am still a fragile vessel. Now I have need
of strength, it has deserted me.</p>

<p>Keele &#8212; &#8220;Dark Angel of our desires, with indiscriminate death and prayers,
return us to our original state.&#8221;</p>

<p>I am no Ayanami. I am not your doll, even if I am your creation, however
indirectly. Though yours is the easiest choice to make, I will not.
Destruction renders everything I have done meaningless, the effort wasted,
and I will not have that.</p>

<p>Gendo &#8212; &#8220;I had been waiting for this moment for so long&#8230; To finally be
with Yui again. And only you remain to unite us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Indeed, I am not her. There is that of her in Unit 01. But can I
selflessly grant an essentially selfish wish?</p>

<p>Maya &#8212; &#8220;Asuka&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>Yes, there is a reason for carrying on, however trite, however banal, or
sentimental it might seem. Another person who cares for me despite my all too
human failings. One who would &#8212; by definition &#8212; not be there if I succumbed
to the lure of Solipsist Nation, the empty Nirvana of the oceans of LCL,
where all are one, and thereby none, just a circular gaze at one collective
navel.</p>

<p>There must be a better paradise than that; but to achieve it I must cast
aside that option, for all that it is now at hand. It is not that a paradise
needs to be hard won to be worthwhile &#8212; has this not been a hard enough road?
&#8212; but that the tools and goals need to be comprehensible. We need to become
finer beings first. Being all that we can be will be a good first step.</p>

<p>I pass through this crux.</p>

<p>The future belongs to me.</p>

<p>I awaken to light.</p>

<hr class="spoiler" />

<p id="wishyouwerehere">[<em>Scene: The whiteness becomes a blank sheet of
paper &#8212; what is beyond is neutrally coloured, unfocussed. A hand begins
writing with a simple looking pen. The words are set down in German, but
after a few seconds, the ink writhes on the page and forms Kanji instead,
translating the original text. The handwriting is clearly the same
person's.</em></p>

<p><em>Asuka's voice narrates the letter as she writes, with the sound of surf and
sea birds in the background. Every so often, she uses the pen to delete or
pick up and move some of the words.</em>]</p>

<p>After all these years, I'm finally getting to do the round the world tour
that I had to lie about during the old days at NERV &#8212; and it's being
wonderful! Even if it has involved spending far too long in the insalubrious
climate of central Asia &#8212; it helped that we were there as honoured guests of
the Khalifa &#8212; you know that she was Maya's lover, back in their student days,
don't you? &#8212; but that didn't make it any more pleasant outside.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[<em>Flashback &#8212; the photo in Maya's apartment.</em>]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But there's another, more serious reason to write &#8212; to congratulate you on
your election victory. Who would have thought that you'd end up as Prime
Minister at your age? I would never have thought it would happen this side of
the binary millennium, reputation or not, and even if the job is more simply
ceremonial than it used to be. And how long will you manage to stay that
respectable?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This year, I shall be there for the reunion. A chance to see everyone in
the flesh again, rather than just in virtuals; the comforting ritual of
sharing of food &#8212; and I'll hold you to that no expense spared dinner you
promised us, at long last. What is surprising, is that after all this time,
my quirky little family is the nearest we all of us have to anything
traditional &#8212; me, the only one who explicitly swore off child-rearing! &#8212;
though I did see the pictures Hikari passed on of Kensuke and his little &#8212;
not so little now, since she's starting school soon, I guess &#8212; girl
Misato.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I <em>think</em> it's a better world now than the one I was born to, this
Awakened world, after the Harrowing, the Anti-Rapture, where those who could
not face the task ahead were granted Nirvana. If only poor Mihara-san had
survived, to see that he had given us the key, in the form of the loving
slaves and guardians that he called persocoms, to fashion a society that
might in time become better yet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And for us who were there, blessed anonymity, for those who chose it. I
managed to surprise myself earlier in the year when I saw the new children's
craze, the little fighting dolls they call angels, that I could just smile,
and contemplate the irony, with no-one else around any the wiser.</p>

<p>At times, I wonder at what really became of the world, wonder was it all
too easy? Is this all just a dream, or a simulation? And could I ever tell if
it were? Some nights I still awaken with stench of LCL in my nostrils,
haunted by the visions of all the various dead and blasted earths I saw, all
the futile seas of orgasmine locked in that endless moment, and know that it
was not easy in the slightest. Yet all the same, I wonder, one day, will I
wake up in the entry plug once more, and have to make the same &#8212; or a subtly
different &#8212; choice all over again?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[<em>Collage of images &#8212; a barren earth under a red bridge of souls; a
figure stirring on a darkened shore; Ayanami in lotus floating in a sea of
LCL; an endless field of Evangelions, all impaled on Lances.</em>]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That has haunted me ever since the four of us woke on the lake shore,
under the benign gazes of the Dancers, to the sound of approaching
helicopters, and through all the uncertain days that followed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[<em>Image &#8212; the three giant dancers, in red and white and blue, their
faces are all Ayanami's and all are ecstatic. They appear almost transparent,
slowly circling around a similarly insubstantial Grail, over the Tokyo-3
lake. Asuka, Misaki, Freya, and Shinji lie cast up upon the beach. The sound
of whirling rotor blades can be heard.</em>]</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The one thing that does give me hope is in a little project of mine
that I've only recently found the time and resources to complete &#8212; 
rendering what remains of Gendo Ikari's notes from the original Enochian.
What he &#8212; and the Committee &#8212; were wont to refer to as 
&#8220;Human Instrumentality&#8221;, later commentators have often 
rendered as &#8220;Human Complement&#8221; or &#8220;Human Complementation&#8221;.</p>

<p>And there I think they missed the major clue.  Everything else &#8212; NERV,
SEELE, Gehirn, Eva &#8212; is in German; so why choose a Romance root?</p>

<p>The secret, revealed at last, is that it is not completion &#8212; the most
idiomatic translation of Gendo Ikari's Great Work would be &#8220;The Human 
Fulfillment Program&#8221;.  And I think it is still continuing all about us,
even as I write.</p>

<p>And on lighter matters &#8212; no, before you ask, I've not bothered to get that eye done, though it
would be simple enough now, and even though it still surprises me when I
really look in a mirror. When I need to, I just wear shades, so that no-one
will tell that this crazy girl has one eye red, and the other blue.</p>

<p>More when we see you, next week.</p>

<h2>Finale &#8212; Pale Blue Dot</h2>

<p>[<em>Outro track plays over this &#8212; <a href="samples/ed-26.mp3"><cite>Forever Autumn</cite></a> &#8212; Jeff
Wayne</em>]</p>

<p>The viewpoint draws back. We see Asuka, head and shoulders, rear
three-quarter view. Her hair is long again, and bunched in a pony-tail. She
gives the letter a final scan, then taps it with the pen, twice. The writing
fades.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that's business seen to,&#8221; she says.</p>

<p>She is wearing a pale grey top and white slacks. As the camera continues
to pull back, we see Maya sitting next to her, in a long, pale blue, summer
dress, and kneeling, on the other side, where she had clearly been reading
the letter as it was being written, Freya, the persocom, unchanged with the
passage of time.</p>

<p>They are sitting on a beach, facing across a bay where small sailing boats
are moored, and on the far side, a small town, half lost amongst trees.</p>

<p>The camera tracks around, and we see the three of them, smiling. Behind is
a promenade, where people &#8212; and persocoms &#8212; walk, skate or cycle by, beyond
that, a scattering of shops and houses.</p>

<p>The camera continues to pull back, to show the town to be a sprinkling of
habitation amongst virgin bush, then it becomes lost in the scope of the bay.
The sky above darkens, and the curve of the Earth is visible. New Zealand,
then all Australasia, is in view. There is the usual patterning of cloud over
the dark blue of the waters, Pacific, Indian, and an Antarctic Ocean that now
extends all the way to the pole, the scars of Second Impact now healed, as lit 
in the late morning where Asuka sits.</p>

<p>Further out, the whole disk of the Earth now visible, and soon the moon
too.</p>

<p>And distance reduces the disk to just a point, lost amongst the stars.</p>

spring (and many hours in front of a phosphor screen where I could have been
