<h1>Misaki's Nervous Afternoon [11b]</h1>

<div id="upperblaze" class="hikaru">

<div id="content">
<p>Misaki was lost. She had carefully memorised the directions that Icchan
had given her, but now there was no left turn when she was expecting one. And
there was no-one about to ask. She wished that she could find her way around
as confidently as Captain Katsuragi &#8212; Misato-san &#8212; did.</p>

<p>And then she saw someone. Up ahead, wearing a school outfit like hers,
with distinctive red hair. She was saved. She just needed to follow
Soryu-san.</p>

<p>Ah, perhaps that door Asuka had taken was the turn she was looking for.
She hurried after, to find that this was just the women's rest-room. But she
could wait here for Soryu-san &#8212; Pilot Soryu, she corrected herself.</p>

<p>It had been a very strange afternoon, not the sort of thing she had
expected of her first day at a new school. The tests hadn't been anything she
had anticipated. Mostly it had been medical sorts of tests, until lunch-time,
when she had been taken to lunch with Icchan and his colleagues. But then
after lunch there had been the strangest sort of personality test, that
looked on the surface like ones she had read in magazines, but was all
slightly twisted, like one question that stuck in her memory &#8212;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&#8220;Rank in order of their beauty: a flame, a thorn, a blade, a
  serpent.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then had come the bit that was almost fun &#8212; she had been taken back to
Icchan's lab, and been wired up in one of the special chairs, and then he
placed a heavy helmet on her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a simulator,&#8221; he explained, as a screen extended itself in front
of her face. &#8220;Without actually moving your body, I'd like you to make the
image on the screen move.&#8221;</p>

<p>She thought about it for a while. Was this what she thought it was? She
tentatively began her Spirit Warriors warm-up, a simple half-dance, half-kata
for her d&aelig;mon. would it work? For a moment, she had not been sure, and then
everything fell into place. It wasn't quite the same, but close enough. She
grinned &#8212; this was not so bad after all.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now we make things more difficult,&#8221; Icchan had said, and she had been
given more complex tasks to perform, while the chair she was in started to
shake, and twist around, so she had to hang on and concentrate on not falling
out as well. That had gone on for simply ages, until she had been on the edge
of motion sickness, before she had been allowed a brief rest. And then she
had been sent off to join the other pilots for even more tests.</p>

<p>A cubicle door opened, and Asuka emerged.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Pilot Soryu.&#8221; Here, it seemed only right that she should
accord Asuka her title in respect.</p>

<p>&#8220;Misakichi? What are you doing here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Learning to be an Eva pilot, like you.&#8221; She didn't know if Asuka had
been told anything, or whether this was coming as a surprise to everyone. The
redhead looked straight at her, then with a shake of her head. made for the
door.</p>

<p>&#8220;You might be an Eva pilot like the others.&#8221; she said as she went.
Misaki hurried to follow.</p>

<p>Yes, she thought, there were the others that Koutarou had mentioned,
though they'd not been at school in the brief time she'd been there.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven't met the other pilots yet. Icchan-san said I would soon, in
the Ready Room. He told me where it was, but I managed to lose my way. I'm so
glad I found you, Soryu-san.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Icchan? Who's that?&#8221;</p>

<p>Hadn't Asuka met him? But he was so obvious and unmistakable&#8212;</p>

<p>&#8220;The funny man in the lab-coat and glasses who works with
Misato-san.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean that old pervert Dr. Mihara? He didn't try and feel you up did
he?&#8221;</p>

<p>What a rude girl!, she thought, blushing. And what a nasty thing to say
about someone who was her friend</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no. He was nice.&#8221; then thoughtfully &#8220;His daughter seemed sad,
though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whatever. And please just call me Asuka. All this Pilot Soryu stuff
makes you sound like wonder-girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who's wonder-girl?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You'll meet her soon enough. That <em xml:lang="de"
title="a plausible rendition of 'baka-Shinji'">dummkopf</em> Shinji-kun won't
be around though. I heard he was ill. Or maybe you're here to be a pilot
because he finally found the balls to quit and stay quit this time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no, I forgot. He doesn't have any.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean&#8230;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Metaphorically, I'm afraid. He's just as much a sex fiend as all the
other boys. He always tries sneaking a peek down my T-shirt whenever he
thinks I won't notice. You're lucky you don't have to share an apartment with
him &#8212; we both live with Misato-san, she's like our guardian.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, here we are. Hello, Maya-san.&#8221; A uniformed woman was waiting for
them outside door marked as their locker room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello Asuka. Is this Pilot Suzuhara?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eeeks! Yes,&#8221; It startled her, the sudden realization that she was for
real a part of all this</p>

<p>&#8220;Maya-san, this is Misakichi,&#8221; Asuka made the introduction. &#8220;Pilot
Suzuhara, this is Lt. Ibuki. She makes things work around here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Maya handed Misakichi the package she had been carrying.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is for you. It's the plug suit that's been made for you after all
the readings that Dr. Mihara took this afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Misaki took the red and white bundle, and looked blankly at it.</p>

<p>Asuka stepped in to explain. &#8220;You need to change into it now. It's a bit
like a diver's suit. You wear it when piloting the Eva &#8212; the pilot's capsule
is filled with oxygenated fluid as part of the shock absorbing system. Plus
the suit has all the life systems telemetry built in, like astronauts used to
have.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;OK, girls,&#8221; Maya cut in, &#8220;Misato-san will chew my ass off if we're late
starting, so get to it.&#8221; and opened the door for them.</p>

<p>There was another girl &#8212; another pilot &#8212; already there, half undressed,
meticulously folding her other clothes, clothes that looked like the same
school uniform the two of them were wearing. She looked up as they entered,
glancing first at Asuka, without any expression, then at Misaki, and
blinked her strange red eyes slowly, twice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Misakichi, wonder-girl. Pilot Ayanami, Pilot Suzuhara,&#8221; Asuka
introduced them all in one breath, them walked off to the other end of the
room.</p>

<p>Misaki looked at the blue-haired girl standing there in her underwear,
staring dispassionately at her. This was Asuka's wonder-girl? There was
certainly something out of the ordinary about her.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are new here?&#8221; The girl spoke, in a quiet, distant, voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Suzuhara Misaki. Or Misakichi, if you wish. I was just called here
today, and I don't know what to do now. Could you help me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must undress, like this,&#8221; and she shed her last garments, &#8220;and then
don your suit. Choose any one of the lockers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Misaki started to undress, as the other girl waited. She placed her
clothes in one of the lockers, and then turned her attention to the bundle
that was her plug suit. Unfolded, it seemed huge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Excuse me, senpai,&#8221; she asked Ayanami, who was still observing her in a
distant sort of way, &#8220;but&#8230;&#8221; She held out the suit, making the problem
obvious.</p>

<p>A small tremor passed Ayanami's face, as if to indicate that she had been
taken aback by something.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will be Rei &#8212; that will be more efficient.&#8221; she decided after a pause.
&#8220;Ayanami Rei,&#8221; she added in way of explanation. &#8220;The suit will adjust to fit.
Put it on, and I will demonstrate.&#8221;</p>

<p>The suit felt vaguely unpleasant as she wriggled into it. Rei helped her
with the fastening. But it was still too big and baggy, fitting only where it
touched.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you use the actuator at the right wrist.&#8221; Rei took her forearm
and pointed to the big button. She pressed it, and the fabric of the suit
shrank to clasp her whole body in its clammy embrace. She shivered a little
to try to ease the feeling, but didn't let that get in the way of
formalities.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Rei.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are welcome, Misaki.&#8221;</p>
<hr />

<p>&#8220;LCL injection commencing,&#8221; the voice came through the headset that Misaki
was wearing. Sitting in the dim interior of the plug, she could not see what
was happening, but there was a change in the background noise, and a slightly
salt smell. Then warmth was creeping up her body, pressing gently around
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is where the fun begins, new girl,&#8221; Asuka spoke, her image appearing
floating off to one side. Misaki watched the screen as fluid engulfed Asuka's
face, and she lay back, and exhaled a great cloud of bubbles. She grimaced
briefly as she inhaled, then &#8220;Twice the fun on the way back.&#8221;</p>

<p>In her own plug, the fluid was up to her neck. She had to be brave, but it
was hard. She tried to copy Asuka, breathing out, and then, before she even
thought about taking a breath, her reflexes took over and she started to form
the intention to swim for the surface. And in that instant she also gave an
involuntary gasp. The warm liquid streamed through her sinuses, a sensation
worse than the feeling of drowning in phlegm at the height of a bad cold, the
same metallic, biological tang. She coughed and spluttered some more,
releasing a last flurry of bubbles.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well done, Misaki,&#8221; Misato-san's image displaced Asuka's.</p>

<p>She tried to smile back, despite the icky feeling, like she was
suffocating. In the background she could hear some sort of countdown &#8212; or up
&#8212; as the tightness and pressure seemed to grow in her chest. Then suddenly,
the feeling became obvious. To her amazement, she was breathing comfortably;
but the tightness she felt was from sadness, as if she were about to cry. But
why should she be feeling sad?</p>

<p>&#8220;Passed first threshold,&#8221; came the commentary; and with the words, Misaki
suddenly had the feeling she was not alone. She could fell the presence of
someone else, a little boy, who was all alone. It was his sorrow she could
feel. She felt her own sudden upwelling of sympathy &#8212; she would have to care
for him, else her own heart would break.</p>

<p>She remembered the manga she had read the previous night, one of a stack
that Shouko had passed over to her, where a girl her own age had had to take
on and bear the hurts of a whole world. As an Eva pilot, she would have to
protect this world &#8212; so surely she too should be able to bear some of its
burden.</p>

<p>She couldn't tell if she had wept, sitting here immersed in LCL, but her
breathing had steadied as she made that decision, that she would have to be
brave, to shield and protect that boy, whoever he was; and it was as if she
had sailed out from a raging torrent into calm waters, but that calm was just
a surface over profound deeps &#8212; and in those deeps, something moved. She felt
herself falling into it, something vast, aloof.</p>

<p>Her resolve nearly failed her, she almost tried to scream, as she was
swept up. Something engulfed her, but in an almost familiar way. Eyes closed,
she took a deep breath, exhaled and then opened her eyes to look around. For
a brief while, colours mottled the darkness as if she had not opened her
eyes; then her sight clouded over with strange geometric shapes, that flowed,
and finally coalesced into a model city, where she stood in a street that was
just a narrow corridor.</p>

<p>She had the strongest feeling that she was looking out of someone else's
eyes, was inhabiting another's body. She raised her right hand to see, and
saw herself armoured in purple and green. The fingers responded as she
clenched and unclenched her fist, all to an accompaniment from the deeps of
some vast amusement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Misaki,&#8221; Misato's image appeared, smiling, superimposed on the city, &#8220;The
test is over now. We'll be bringing you back shortly.&#8221; and was gone.</p>

<p>The brief interruption of the normal world vanished, leaving her alone
again with this Presence. Was that the Evangelion? Icchan had said that they
were almost alive. It was the strangest feeling half familiar, half alien.
She felt that she was here without any right to be, her presence at first
just tolerated &#8212; but that she had done something right, had passed some
test, one that she doubted that Misato or Icchan had known of, and had been
accepted.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is your name?&#8221; she asked of the void.</p>

<p>Gusts of surprise and delight buffeted her, and then she felt herself
descending from this exalted state, becoming just Misaki once again. Around
her, she heard the countdown being unwound. But in the dying instants of
synchronization, she thought she heard a reply. Or maybe she had just
imagined it.</p>

<p>And then she was sitting there in the entry plug, in the dim lighting,
coughing and choking as she hawked up the last of the fluid from her lungs.
She had wondered at the almost grim manner in which the other pilots had
approached the test. Perhaps now she had some inkling of why. But when she
had been released from the entry plug, to return with the others, she stood
as straight as she could, and as they did not show distress, she would not
either.</p>
<hr />

<p>Misaki sat, towelling her hair, now that it had been washed clean of the
liquid. Now she had a few moments to herself, she felt the need to talk, to
try and express what it was that had happened. But the only other people to
whom she might be able to talk and expect them to have shared the experience
were the two other pilots. Asuka-senpai was sitting with her back to all of
them, as she carefully brushed her long hair, while Rei-senpai just sat in
silence, shutting out the world like a commuter on a crowded train. Neither
seemed ready to invite conversation.</p>

<p>What had happened? How could she put into words what she had felt? The
feelings of being both drowned and comforted in the bath of LCL, the trauma
of emergence into air once again, a trauma that was fading fast. And in
between &#8212; it had been like the exercise she had been put through before, just
as that had been similar to finding and mastering a d&aelig;mon in Spirit
Warriors. But this had been like the reality to a drawing or a photograph.
There was something else, not part of herself, that she had been in contact
with. And she thought it had told her a name; though she could not swear that
it was not just a faint rustling or sighing noise from the machinery. The
name, Yui.</p>

<p>Her ruminations were interrupted when Lt Ibuki summoned them for a
debriefing.</p>
<hr />

<p>It turned out to be rather less formal than that. Misato read out their
results &#8212; numbers that didn't mean anything to her, though she noted that her
own was the lowest, and Asuka-senpai's the highest, and then, that business
over, crouched down a little, hands on knees, to match their eye levels, and
smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm very pleased with you all,&#8221; Misato said, &#8220;especially Misakichi, who
is going to have the least rewarding job of all of you Children, as the
reserve pilot.&#8221;</p>

<p>It sounded like she was about to say more along those lines when Misaki
saw her look up, past the pilots and straighten up, saluting hastily. Misaki
started to turn to face whatever important person this might be. She found
herself looking up at a tall man with a beard and glasses.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Captain,&#8221; he asked, &#8220;How did Suzuhara-kun perform in today's
tests?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suzuhara Misaki-san,&#8221; Misato replied, over Misaki's head, &#8220;did extremely
well. As good as Rei was after six months. Almost as good as Shinji-kun in his
first test.&#8221;</p>

<p>The bearded man looked surprised at something, and Misaki was starting to
be worried that there was something wrong, or that she had done something not
quite right, when she felt Misato's hand on her arm, felt the woman step up
close behind her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Commander, as instructed, this is Pilot Suzuhara.&#8221;</p>
<hr />

<p>Evening had drawn on, the sun low, painting the city in blood red light,
when she finally returned home. Maya had driven her back, in one of the
official jeeps, a couple of unsmiling men in dark suits accompanying them.</p>

<p>Even as she and Maya were walking from the jeep, the front door flew open,
and Shouko appeared, calling her name.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Misaki-chan!&#8221;</p>

<p>And then she spotted Maya's uniform, the two minders sitting in the back
seat of the jeep out on the road outside, and her expression of worry turned
to a frown.</p>

<p>&#8220;You've not managed to get into some sort of trouble already, have
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the contrary, Asami-san. You should be proud of your niece,&#8221; Maya
replied, &#8220;She has been doing her civic duty.&#8221;</p>

<p>She pulled out her NERV card, and showed it to Shouko.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I come in? There are several things we need to discuss about how
things will be organized to support Pilot Suzuhara in work and in school.&#8221;</p>
