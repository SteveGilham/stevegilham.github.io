    <div class="floatright"><img src="nerv-open.png" height="275" width="275" title=""

    <p>My contribution to Eva on the Web started
      with a pair of stories written with the
      intent of exploring options which might end up with Asuka better off than the
      bleak &#8220;This sucks&#8221; ending of <cite>End of</cite>. But this is
      Evangelion, which doesn't <em>do</em> happy endings, so we just have to see
      where those journeys take us.</p>

    <p>And at the same time, writing fics provides a vehicle for putting forth
      some interpretations that I can read into the noisy data. At least in narrative
      form, the exercise in Rorschach blot reading feels better to me than merely
      expounding the raw &#8220;this is what <em>I</em> think happened&#8221; &#8212;
      I give back ambiguity as well.</p>

    <p>While watching the original episodes, it was always more Rei that I found
      as an identification character with the quiet reserved personality (especially her
      &#8220;leadership&#8221; style in Episode 11) &#8212; Shinji was never a contender,
      always trying to assert himself at exactly the wrong, the most self-defeating, time.
      But after seeing <cite>End of Evangelion</cite> it really came
      to me that Rei was really always an NPC, an enigma, and it was Asuka who was
      the character who ended up with my sympathies.</p>

    <p>Informing the spin I put on things, my take on the secret agenda of NERV
      can be read from this variant logo (roughly done, I fear, as the B-spline
      tool I have doesn't do fit-to-circular-path at all well).</p>

    <p>No, this isn't <cite>Serial Experiments
        Evangelion</cite> (yet). But the sentiment of the
      <cite>Lain</cite> slogan is most appropriate to this purpose &#8212; NGE is the first
      visual media context I'd seen in which the narrative concludes after the launch of a
      Singularity (along quasi-Vingean lines), even if in <cite>End of</cite> the hard
      take-off somewhat falls to pieces. Third Impact as Singularity, or at least a
      metaphor for Singularity really informs the approach I've taken.

    <p><cite>Neon Genesis Evangelion</cite> is, of course, creation of and
      copyright to GAINAX/Project Eva, without whom none of this would have been
      possible; all this blatantly derivative work is offered up as a humble
      acknowledgement that the series did make people think, and care for the
      characters.</p>

    <p>These fics are respectfully dedicated to Hideki Anno, for <cite>The End
        of Evangelion</cite> &#8212; a film that struck so deeply that it has taken me all
      spring (and many hours in front of a phosphor screen where I could have been
      reading in my garden while twilight lingered until well after 9pm) to begin to
      express the impact that it made on me.</p>
