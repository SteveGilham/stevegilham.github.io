    <p>We can see the shadows of the episodes we actually saw; and parts that are
      beyond what even fanfics reach.</p>

    <h2>Original EoTV</h2>

    <p>From the Renewal box-set extras, a pre-production image of the scrapped
      original TV episode 25, showing that the EoE scenario was not an afterthought:</p>

    <img src="Ep25Air-Splat.jpg" height="464" width="639" alt="Misato rescues Shinji" />

    Other references to events that only make sense if EoE is already unfolding
    in the physical world are laced throughout the episode 25 we did eventually see:

    <ul>
      <li><a href="25-06-12.jpg">6m12s : EVA-02 in the lake</a></li>
      <li><a href="25-06-21.jpg">6m21s : Asuka feels useless at the controls</a></li>
      <li><a href="25-10-38.jpg">10m38s : Ritsuko in the LCL</a></li>
      <li><a href="25-10-43.jpg">10m43s : Misato KIA</a></li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Live Action Alternate Sequence</h2>

    <p>There is <a href="http://www.evamonkey.com/live_action_segment.avi">footage</a> and <a
        href="http://www.evaotaku.com/html/alteva.html">script</a> out there for
      a live-action sequence that takes place in some alternate future where Shinji
      never was, and Asuka, improbably, becomes an office lady, rather than a
      neurotic scientist like Ritsuko.</p>

    <h2>Many Endings</h2>

    <p>I'm not sure if any of this really impacts on <a href="deathandcomplementation.html">my take on the final
        scene</a>. I don't
      really have an obvious mechanism for how the foreground details of this scene
      actually happened that is consistent with what we see in a few moments.</p>
    <img src="m26_C461_gnr,graves.jpg" height="272" width="475"
      alt="memorial markers on the shore, one broken; half of GNR's head in the distance" />

    <p>It seems that the ending we got was barely conjured out of quantum maybes.
      One take had Asuka appear and scornfully kick down the memorial marker (shown
      fallen, above, and marked as &#x201c;kicked down&#x201d; in the final story
      boards). Another had Shinji holding hands with what turned out to be a
      disembodied arm.</p>

    <p>The latter survives almost as an in-joke, when we see just Asuka's forearm
      &#x2014; I wonder if the marker is evidence of a similar palimpsest approach
      to the ending.</p>

    <p>And even the final words were conjured up when Miyamura Yuuko ad libbed
      instead of saying something to the effect of &#x201c;No, I won't let you kill
      me.&#x201d; as had been scripted.</p>

    <p><a
        href="http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.anime.misc/browse_frm/thread/e493eedfca8f73bb/9f4756aa16fbcb09#9f4756aa16fbcb09">This
        source</a>
      claims that</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        The show ended by Asuka's line: &#8220;Kimochiwarui&#8221;
        [disgusting]. Miyamura Yuko testified that the last
        line in the original script was &#8220;I hate to be killed by
        a bastard like you&#8221;, but she and Anno-san had a
        discussion about the line and he took what she told him.
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>though the original Japanese was possibly more accurately rendered
      by &#8220;someone like you&#8221; used in derogatory mode.</p>

    <p>There is more relevant data here : <a href="http://animaniajapan.livedoor.biz/archives/17687653.html">Asuka's
        final line in the Evangelion movie was Miyamura's idea</a>.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Miyamura:<br />
        I had been thinking directors should convey their ideal how the show shold be to us. But Annno pitchs us
        questions such as &#8220;What do you think for yourself if things went on such and such ways to
        you?&#8221;<br />
        After recording all lines of the movie, I was called to the studio because the final line needed to be revised.
        Ogata came there too as it was Asuka and Shinji's scene.<br />
        Asuka's final line was &#8220;Anta nankani korosareru nowa mappira yo!&#8221; in the film
        scenario. Annno didn't live with my line no matter how many times I tried. Ogata and
        I were at a loss how we should play what Annno wanted to express; she even
        tried to ride on me and choke me to meet his demand. He must have been pursuing reality.<br />
        Concerning the final line we adopted, I'm not sure whether I should say about it in fact.
        At last Anno asked me &#8220;Miyamura, just imagine you are sleeping in your
        bed and a stranger sneaks into your room. He can rape you anytime as you are
        asleep but he doesn't. Instead, he masturbates looking at you, when you wake
        up and know what he did to you. What do you think you would say?&#8221;<br />
        I had been thinking he was a strange man, but at that moment I felt disgusting. So
        I told him that I thought &#8220;Disgusting&#8221;. And then he sighed and said &#8220;&#8230; thought as
        much.&#8221; He said.
        &#8220;I thought as much.&#8221;
