    <p>[<em>Intro track &#8212; <cite>Fallen Angel</cite> : Blve &Ouml;yster Cvlt</em>]</p>

    <p>This just had to be the suckiest week of her life, thought Asuka, as she
      sat on her bed, combing her towel-dry hair. Or at least the weirdest. There
      had been the usual suckage &#8212; tests where what should have been a 100% score
      being knocked down to merely average on account of her handwriting &#8212; when in
      real life she would just be able to type the kana and have the correct kanji
      selected; having to put up with Shinji and his dorky friends. And then there
      was Pilot Suzuhara.</p>

    <p>It seemed that it wasn't enough to show that she could stand in for Shinji
      at a pinch. The first Asuka caught of this was a phone call Misato had taken
      at the flat one evening at the beginning of the week. Asuka had been
      deadening her brain in front of the TV when she heard &#8220;In Unit 00? But even
      Rei&#8230;&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Trouble?&#8221; she had asked, when the call was over.</p>

    <p>&#8220;No, &#8221; was the reply, &#8220;It was just Ritsuko confirming tomorrow's harmonics
      tests.&#8221;</p>
    <hr />

    <p>The next day, the three of them &#8212; Shinji, Misaki, and herself, had walked
      together from school. Rei had not shown up &#8212; which seemed to be more the rule
      than the exception. The sky was overcast, the heat sultry, the air still and
      heavy, but the cicadas still trilled in the trees like static on an old FM
      station, immediate entropy in the soundtrack of her life.</p>

    <p>They had met up with Misato and were heading down to the main cage when
      things started to get a bit crazy. Dr. Mihara had appeared out of nowhere and
      dragged Misato and Misakichi off down a side corridor. She and Shinji had
      started to follow, when this strange girl stepped out in front of them. She
      was wearing a schoolgirl sailor <em xml:lang="ja">fuku</em>, and had absurdly
      long fair hair.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Please wait here, or continue to the changing rooms to prepare for your
      tests.&#8221;</p>

    <p>For a moment, everyone just stood there, staring. Then, evidently having
      delivered the message she was supposed to, the girl had turned to her, and,
      placing her hand between her own small breasts, asked in a desolate voice&#8212;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Pilot Soryu, what does it mean when you feel an emptiness here?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;What are you on about?&#8221; she had replied. This was worse than an encounter
      with a garrulous wino.</p>

    <p>Then the girl had turned to Shinji and asked the same question, and he had
      just looked dumbstruck. She then stepped up to him, placed her hand on his
      chest, then rested her head against that hand.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Does Pilot Ikari have an emptiness here?&#8221;</p>

    <p>He had reddened, recoiled. &#8220;I&#8230;&#8221; he stammered. &#8220;I don't want to talk about
      that sort of stuff.&#8221; and gingerly disengaged himself.</p>

    <p>Asuka remembered what Misakichi had said about Dr. Mihara's daughter being
      sad. She guessed that this must be the girl that she meant. But, seeing her,
      she didn't think it could be his real daughter, any more than Rei was the
      Commander's.</p>

    <p>What was it about this place and weirdos? Did they make them specially?
      She had the nightmare vision of a production line turning out dolls that
      walked and talked like people, but all with some flaw in their mechanisms
      that meant that they couldn't quite act like people. Or maybe they just kept
      the broken ones back.</p>

    <p>She was dragged out of this paranoid fantasy by the return of Misato and
      Misakichi. Misakichi had beamed at him and said &#8220;Cheer up, Shinji, don't look
      so sad.&#8221; and given him a big hug.</p>

    <p>Which of course he hadn't known how to deal with.</p>

    <p>Shinji had looked bemused for the rest of the evening &#8212; which probably
      accounted for how come Misaki had scored better in Unit 00 than he had in
      Unit 01. And then afterwards, Ritsuko had told her that next test she could
      sit out while Misaki would work with Unit 02 &#8212; her Unit 02.</p>

    <p>So today, after school, the others had gone for their tests &#8212; and she had
      taken the opportunity to try and see Kaji. But he was not around, so all that
      had happened was that she had been caught out when the heavens had opened,
      leaving her drenched to the skin.</p>

    <p>The sound of the front door opening caught her attention. Shinji? Unlikely
      to be Misato &#8212; she was working the night shift this weekend.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I'll get us some towels.&#8221; &#8212; Shinji &#8212; and company.</p>

    <p>Right now, she was not in the mood for listening to him and his laddish
      mates.</p>

    <p>&#8220;We'll have to be quiet &#8212; Misato will be asleep.&#8221;</p>

    <p>She put the hairbrush down and on bare feet went to her bedroom door,
      intending to give them a piece of her mind. She slid the door open a crack,
      took a deep breath &#8212; and stood there in slack mouthed amazement.</p>

    <p>It wasn't the three stooges, after all &#8212; but Shinji and Misaki. Holding
      hands, no less! And only reluctantly letting go as he headed to the bathroom
      to fetch the towels.</p>

    <p>The concept of Shinji with a girlfriend was not something she could easily
      get her head around. She was still standing there, gawping, when, a few
      moments later, Misato emerged from her room, dressed ready for work.</p>

    <p>Misato had just made a vague &#8220;Hello.&#8221; when Misakichi bowed and said
      &#8220;Congratulations on your promotion to Major, Misato.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Uh, congratulations, &#8221; Shinji belatedly added, after a visible nudge in
      the ribs.</p>

    <p>&#8220;You can get your own suppers, can't you?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221; beamed Misaki.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Bye, then, you two. Bye, Asuka.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Bye, Misato!&#8221; She joined in the chorus, opening her door a bit wider.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Hello, Asuka, &#8221; Misakichi, and then to the company in general, &#8220;I'll cook
      us all something to eat.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Fine, Let me know when it's ready.&#8221; and, as best she could, slammed her
      door. Somehow, the thought of those two being all lovey-dovey over supper was
      doing more to put her off her food than if Misato had offered to cook
      again.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Next evening they held a party to celebrate Misato's promotion.</p>

    <p>Shinji had invited Toji and Kensuke, but seemed only to have eyes for
      Misakichi. But the lads didn't seem to notice &#8212; they were too busy worshipping
      Misato, or, at least, Misato's body. Rei, thankfully, was a no show, and even
      though they had been unable to persuade Misaki not to invite Dr. Mihara, he
      too had not shown. And, much to Asuka's disgust, Kaji also seemed to be a
      no-show. At least she had Hikari there to talk girl-talk with.</p>

    <p>Only the guest of honour seemed ill at ease. Not surprising with those two
      leering at her all the time like that. When Hikari turned to talk to Misaki,
      she took the chance to chide Misato, &#8220;C'mon, Misato. Don't worry about these
      jerks. Promotions don't happen every day. The Commander must have noticed you
      beavering away, even if he is always a grouch.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Misato only raised a weak half smile at that. She seemed almost as spacy
      this evening as Shinji often did, and this was without having yet hardly
      started on the beer. This was when being stuck in a 14&#8211;year-old body sucked.
      She had to play kiddy stuff with the juniors rather than being taken
      seriously &#8212; even for girl talk &#8212; by the older folk. Misato was probably
      waiting for a chance to talk something over, but wanting Ritsuko to talk it
      over with. It was the same with Kaji &#8212; these days, he only seemed to see her
      body, and not her mind.</p>

    <p>The trouble was that there weren't that many eligible males around who
      weren't just teenage jerks. She had thought on the sea voyage here that Kaji
      had been able to see past the superficial and appreciate her for herself, but
      since then, he had just been distant. If it had just been something physical,
      she could have had the boys queueing up &#8212; she might even have the attention
      of creepy Dr. Mihara &#8212; but that itch she could scratch for herself well
      enough, when it became intolerable.</p>

    <p>The doorbell sounded. That just had to be Kaji!</p>

    <p>And it was :-) Along with Ritsuko :-( They just happened to meet, he
      claimed. As if! She wasn't sure it it was herself or Misato &#8212; as Kaji's ex- &#8212;
      who was more pissed off at this.</p>

    <p>And then he'd dropped his bombshell. &#8220;Two promotions in one week! First
      Major, now acting Commander while Commander Ikari and Vice-Commander
      Fuyutsuki are away.&#8221;</p>

    <p>The evening never recovered after that &#8212; her classmates had started to
      make their excuses &#8212; even if Misakichi had to be dragged away by Hikari, then
      Kaji had gone, leaving Ritsuko, and she and Shinji had been told to go to
      bed.</p>

    <p>Not that Ritsuko had stayed long after that, either. No girl-to-girl talk
      tonight, then.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>And then another Angel.</p>

    <p>She wasn't sure why Misato had called them to this particular place, at
      the bottom of one of the towers that withdrew into the geofront, a glass
      floor that showed the panorama, hundreds of meters below. She knew that the
      structure would support much more than the few people it was being called
      upon to do now, so strode out confidently. Rei was off roster &#8212; but probably
      wouldn't have even noticed the view. Shinji and Misakichi were rather more
      hesitant, though.</p>

    <p>The last angel had been content to walk up to them and weep molecular acid
      from a few meters away. This one was going to hurl itself down from orbit.
      And Misato had this crazy plan.</p>

    <p>Did she think that this was the World Cup, or something? If they failed
      this save, then it would really be a case of &#8220;They think it's all over. It
      is, now.&#8221;</p>

    <p>And all the surrounding bull. A steak dinner to celebrate &#8212; why not just
      come out and make it a Mos-burger. Sure, back when she'd been a kid, food had
      been short, and mostly local, seasonal fare, that had had her grandparents
      comparing it to the 1960s. But now, well everyone reckoned that they'd
      recovered to a point where all they had lost was ten years &#8212; and three
      billion people.</p>

    <p>If they were going to eat out &#8212; and although anything was better than
      Misato offering to cook &#8212; there was a nice Italian place she'd seen &#8212; and a
      Kiwi Pac-Rim fusion restaurant that had just opened to good reviews.</p>

    <p>And that pi-jaw about wills. Sure it was as per regs &#8212; but what did she
      have to dispose of? She had two published papers, one as sole author, in
      respected, peer reviewed, open access journals, as her legacy; and if worst
      came to worst, it wouldn't be her problem to worry about how to dispose of
      her stuff. If there was any of it left to find.</p>

    <p>At least the others backed her on that one. When she'd tried them on the
      meal thing, Misaki had said &#8220;That's not very nice. Misato's trying to be kind
      to us. You should be kind to her.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Well, she'd be damned if she was going to apologise for something she
      believed to be true &#8212; but she was almost pleasantly surprised to get a
      vigorous response, rather than the usual run of turnips.</p>

    <p>When she'd first met Misaki, she'd thought her a bit of an airhead,
      especially with that silly squeak she gave when startled &#8212; which was easy
      enough to achieve &#8212; but she could be determined when she wanted to be. In a
      way, Asuka was glad of having someone like that around, someone who wouldn't
      take any shit from her or anyone else.</p>

    <p>Maybe it was the will business or something, but Shinji was in an
      unusually talkative mood. As they rode the lift down to the main cage, he
      asked her &#8220;Why do you pilot your Eva?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8216;Lord&#8217;, she thought, For sure it wasn't for the money. She just gave him a
      pat &#8212; verging on flip &#8212; answer.</p>

    <p>&#8220;So you do it to prove you exist?&#8221; he concluded after some thought.</p>

    <p>She rolled her eyes. A five second internet search would do that much &#8212;
      though fortunately most of her more embarrassing early traces had been via a
      fairly anonymous school account. NERV security had insisted, though, that her
      CV page now state that she was travelling the world before resuming her
      studies. Not that he'd likely have so much as left a trace on a chat room
      log.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Why don't you ask her?&#8221; she pointed a thumb at Misaki, who was standing
      there, her feet apart almost in a fighting stance, and a scowl of
      concentration on her face.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Because I was asked, and because I can, &#8221; Misaki turned and spoke before
      being asked. She was all business now. Probably had been when she and Shinji
      had paired up, had made all the running, and the poor boy hadn't known what
      to do.</p>

    <p>The descent achieved, Asuka climbed into the pilot's seat for Unit 02, the
      start of the insertion process, with a shiver of anticipation. Truth be told,
      piloting an Eva came close to being an addiction for her, like a powerful
      stimulant, the way she became that giant.</p>

    <p>Insertion carried on around her &#8212; seat into plug, plug into Eva, then the
      flooding with blood-warm LCL, the moments of discomfort as her body realized
      that it was not being drowned. And then the mental nestling in of
      synchronization.</p>

    <p>But this time, there was something different. It was like she had entered
      her room to find that someone else had just left it, as if things had been
      picked up, then put down not quite where she'd left them?</p>

    <p>No, that wasn't quite it. It was more like a trace, almost a scent, hard
      to identify &#8212; smell was by far her weakest sense &#8212; but it definitely seemed
      female, somehow. It had to be Misaki. She felt a sense of shock &#8212; but there
      was such a strong impression of warmth, openness, honesty, that she could not
      feel outrage. It was a caress, not a violation.</p>

    <p>This was an indirect kiss taken further, a mediated intimacy that came
      close to going all the way. If Shinji had felt this after Misaki had synched
      with Unit 01, then no wonder&#8230; And what had Rei felt? And did Ritsuko know
      or suspect?</p>

    <p>She became aware of her name being called. &#8220;<span xml:lang="de"
        title="Yes, yes.  I was thinking about&#8230;">Ja, ja. Ich dachte an&#8230;</span>&#8221; No,
      girl, get with the program. They don't speak German here. &#8220;Sorry. I was
      thinking about something else.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Are you ready to launch?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;<span xml:lang="de" title="Yes, of course">Ja, nat&uuml;rlich.</span>&#8221;</p>

    <p>Then, after deployment, it was hurry up and wait, holding ready to react
      when there was a sighting of the target.</p>

    <p>And suddenly it was there. A speck of orange, growing rapidly. Unit 01 was
      closest, leaving herself and Misaki to sprint across the suburban
      landscape.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Misaki! Spread your AT field, &#8221; she called as she ran, grabbing for her
      progressive knife. That was what turned a million to one shot into the ghost
      of a plan. They would create a virtual cushion, to absorb and spread the
      impact from something that would rupture the geofront into something that its
      armoured overburden would bear.</p>

    <p>Impact. Steady. Rip into its AT field, open it and join the others in
      digging for its kernel. The mass slumped above them, and then, brighter than
      the fierce scintillation of their blades, whiteout.</p>

    <p>When things settled down again, she checked status. Only minor, superficial
      damage. And over 3 minutes power left. Plenty of time to limp home.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>After the initial debriefing, all the pilots, Rei included, were called
      into one of the ops rooms, while Misato reported the operation to the
      Commander. Of course, Misato was going to be told she'd done well &#8212; but why
      single out Shinji amongst all the pilots? Had the Commander suddenly
      remembered that they were related?</p>

    <p>After the call, when they could speak freely again, Misaki went up to Rei,
      and said &#8220;I'm sorry your Eva got hurt. And I forgot to ask &#8212; what is her
      name?&#8221;</p>

    <p>Rei looked nonplussed. &#8220;Unit 00, &#8221; she replied. Asuka wasn't sure which of
      the two was less with it &#8212; Rei for not seeming to understand the question, or
      Misaki for asking something so dumb in the first place.</p>

    <p>Misaki looked crestfallen.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Shinji's Eva's name is Yui, &#8221; she announced.</p>

    <p>&#8220;But that was my mother's name!&#8221; &#8212; Wow, the boy could react some times.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Well, &#8221; Misaki was laying down the law now, &#8220;She carries you, protects
      you, That makes it the <em>right</em> name, doesn't it?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Uh, I guess so.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Uh-oh, barf alert, the two lovebirds were about to get sentimental. Time,
      thought Asuka, to get priorities straightened out.</p>

    <p>&#8220;You said something about buying dinner, Misato.&#8221;</p>

    <p>If Rei was joining them, as it seemed, she was vegetarian, so that really
      counted the Italian place out, and as any raise Misato might get for her
      promotion wouldn't have come through yet &#8212; and with most of her salary being
      poured into that money-pit of a car, a meal for five at the Kiwi place would
      probably hurt the cash-flow. But she could still tease the lot of them.</p>

    <p>&#8220;And I know just the place&#8230;&#8221;</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>Interlude &#8212; Asuka</h2>

    <p>It stays quiet for a while. The only excitement, if you can call it that,
      is when Ritsuko decides for some reason that we have to synch test naked. I
      don't know which is worse &#8212; thinking that Shinji will be turned on by knowing
      that I'm naked and within arm's reach as we head for our seats, or having him
      be too dull to be excited. I fix my eyes on my destination, clamp one arm
      across my chest, and sprint.</p>

    <h2>Interlude &#8212; Shinji</h2>

    <p>I meet Dr. Mihara while going to one of the tests after school. For once,
      his daughter isn't there with him. I say that I want to tell her something,
      answer the questions she'd asked me.</p>

    <p>He looks sad. &#8220;She isn't well. I'm not sure that's she's going to get
      better.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Then tell her for me &#8212; that it means that someone is missing. And &#8216;not
      any more&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Thank you, &#8221; he says, quietly. &#8220;I will tell her that. I think it might
      make her happy.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Can I really make someone happy?</p>

    <h2>Interlude &#8212; Rei</h2>

    <p>Who am I? What is the bond between Unit 00 and myself? What did she lack
      when Pilot Ikari rode her, that she craved me so?</p>

    <p>Pilot Suzuhara, I can still taste you in Izanami's waters. You sufficed
      for her. Did I tell you her name?</p>

    <p>Life goes on. It would go on without me. I am no more than one of the
      flowers of the field.</p>

    <p>The Commander gives me purpose.</p>

    <p>But why am I?</p>

    <h2>Interlude &#8212; Misaki</h2>

    <p>It is hard being an Eva pilot. Not in the hours after school spent in
      Dr. Akagi's tests when I should be doing homework, not even when I had to
      fight an Angel. It is the other pilots.</p>

    <p>They are all so sad.</p>

    <p>I think I can make Shinji happier &#8212; he laughs, sometimes, when we are
      together.</p>

    <p>I would like to be better friends with Asuka, but she doesn't let anyone
      close. Though I think that she likes me in her own way.</p>

    <p>I wish I knew Rei better. She seems kind and thoughtful, but never quite
      fully awake. As if being an Eva pilot is all she has ever done.</p>
