    <p>There is occasional use of strong language, to the extent
      that as film script these writings might not quite get a 12A certification
      on those grounds. But then <cite>The End of Evangelion</cite> is
      15-rated, after all. There are occasional implicit fan-service
      scenes geared to reference those in the original series (which
      was no more than 12-rated, with the notorious &#8220;Rei emerging from
      the shower&#8221; scene on a PG-rated disk).</p>

    <p>This is a Nancy Wolf story first and foremost, that happens also to interact with
      the NGE setting, a straightforward collision of two &#8220;countdown
      to Singularity&#8221; threads, so I play a bit with some high power
      stuff. A happier end than <cite>End of</cite>, or a worse? You judge.</p>

      <p>A side-story view on the same tale, only from Misaki's point of view,

    <p>Can the power of positive thinking &#8212; and an alternate, slightly older,
      version of almost the very best <cite>Angelic Layer</cite> deus in Japan turn
      the trick? Added elements are drawn broadly from the ladies of Clamp, as
      mutated to fit the post Second Impact world. There are some mild spoilers
      for both <cite>Angelic Layer</cite> and <cite>Chobits</cite>.</p>

    <p>Events are told primarily from Asuka's viewpoint, as they move gradually
      away from the main world-line. Each text is keyed to original episode
      numbers, and operates under the assumption that where the text doesn't
      contradict or modify an original scene, that those events will play out
      pretty much unchanged, without being retold here. And by original, I mean
      original, not even the Director's Cut enhanced version, which I'd not yet
      seen when I wrote the main tale; though episodes 25 and 26 are taken from <cite>The End of Evangelion</cite>.</p>

    <p>Note that Asuka &#8212; and the other characters used for viewpoint from time
      to time &#8212; are not perfect objective observers. Asuka in particular is able
      to misinterpret events, at times perhaps for lack of data, and in any case is
      quite capable of outright lying to herself, especially when remembering events.</p>

    <p>There is occasional use of the vernacular, including a couple of incidents of
      strong language, to the extent that as film script these writings might not quite
      get a UK 12A certification on those grounds. But then <em>The End of Evangelion</em>
      is 15-rated in the UK, and I expect the readers to have seen that. The sex and violence
      levels are no different to those of the source material.</p>

    <p>And as the previous paragraph might have hinted, I'm English, so, as well as
      &#8220;-our&#8221; type spellings, there may be a few idioms from the native dialect
      that are not universal. Hopefully, context should provide the meaning in any
      such cases.</p>

    <h3>Asuka</h3>
    <p>As to Asuka herself &#8212; I've read hints about her being the culmination
      of a eugenic program (even though there seems some ambiguity about what fraction Japanese to
      German), which I worked in indirectly in terms of mentioning a
      meticulous genealogy. I didn't have scope to work in references to having an
      unusual number of her ancestors born on 01&#8211;Jan&#8211;1900, just like Elijah Snow,
      Axel Brass and Jenny Sparks, or the likelihood of such programs in Germany peaking
      in the 1930&#8211;45 time-frame, nor even a hint that this might be an alternate version
      of that line of red-heads that culminates in the Kinnison sisters. The gratuitous
      von Bek reference started off as providing a flip response to one of Kaworu's original
      lines, and stays to increase the subjectivity/ambiguity level in the final episodes.</p>

    <h3>Telling the tales</h3>
    <p>I've tried not to contradict the material that I know of that was
      not actually part of the episodes as first transmitted (and may only exist as
      explanatory text), but in places run up tight against the margins of what I've
      not seen specified.</p>

    <p>This is one for the cognoscenti (both of them) and the half dozen other people in the world in space who are
      familiar with both Eva <em>and</em> the 1950s school story satires of Geoffrey Willans and Ronald Searle. What
      happens when n molesworth, the curse of st custards sees his first anime, and it's NGE?</p>
