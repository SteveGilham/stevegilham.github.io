<h2><cite>Neon Genesis Evangelion</cite> as a view on the Singularity</h2>

<p>Throughout these pages, and my fanac elsewhere, I tend to assume some
basic level of familiarity with the concept of the Technological Singularity;
this page is intended as a beginner's guide to the concept, and a starting
point to learn more, as well as an essay on the Singularitarian aspects of
NGE. There is a lot of jargon, but I will try to explain as I go along. If
all else fails there are useful <a
href="http://www.acceleratingfuture.com/lexicon/">Lexicon</a> and concept <a
href="http://www.acceleratingfuture.com/articles/">introduction</a> sites.</p>

<h3>What is the Singularity?</h3>

<p>Progress is getting <a href="http://www.accelerationwatch.com">faster</a>. Moore's Law (component density on silicon
doubles in less than two years) has held for forty years and more than a
millionfold improvement. I'm probably wearing more computing power than the
average computer when I was born &#x2014; and those filled rooms; my car
probably contains more computing power than most nations had, and my house
certainly does. Music that came on brittle, warp-prone 12" vinyl disks
containing under 25 minutes a side, now comes for hours in digital purity, in
a box the size of a pack of cards. [UPDATE: Since this page was written in
early summer '05, we have had the iPod mini and nano models, which are 
getting to the point where the size of the battery is the limiting factor.]</p>

<p>At its simplest, the weakest form of Singularity is what happens if this
increasing rate of improvement keeps going on for a few more decades; a time
when things have changed so much that we cannot imagine what will then
happen, save that change will keep on happening. (Arguably, from the point of
view of someone from even 2-300 years ago, we are already on the far side of
such a Singularity).</p>

<h3>What form might the Singularity take?</h3>

<p>Simple answer: we don't &#x2014; we can't &#x2014; know, roughly by
definition. But we can take some guesses.</p>

<p>This is where we move to the boundary between several disciplines &#x2014;
rigorous philosophical and technological speculation, applied theology, and
pure, and SF. Science fiction provides a place where the outrageous
speculations can be presented in digestible form and then feed back into the
thinking of others. This is not new &#x2014; SF has always had a mystical
streak (when it is not concerning itself with being an &#x201c;if this goes
on&#x201d; satire on current social trends, or providing a faraway place for
rebadged historical adventures), that concerns itself with the forward
looking view on the Human Condition, and the destiny of the species. This has
tended to feed back into the social groups that read SF, and inform their
thinking, their serious speculation, and their actual works in the real
world. This included &#x201c;the Dream&#x201d;, the mystical view of
spaceflight as the next step after the emergence of life onto the land,
especially noticeable in Arthur C. Clarke's early work, and which informed
the ethos of many NASA engineers during the Apollo days.</p>

<p>Today, the obvious technologies are ones that are cheaper and more
human-scale &#x2014; computers and biotechnology.</p>

<p>The Technological Singularity and the issue of human destiny &#x2014; what
comes after humanity as we know it &#x2014; really started to propagate as a
meme following its emergence in an academically respectable form in <a
href="http://www.aleph.se/Trans/Global/Singularity/sing.html">an essay
written in 1993 by Vernor Vinge</a>, a computer scientist and SF writer with
an interest in the transhuman.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Abstract</p>

  <p></p>

  <p>Within thirty years, we will have the technological means to create
  superhuman intelligence. Shortly after, the human era will be ended.</p>

  <p>Is such progress avoidable? If not to be avoided, can events be guided
  so that we may survive? These questions are investigated. Some possible
  answers (and some further dangers) are presented.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>though it was prefigured in more abstract form by Vinge's own SF-detective
novel <cite><a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312942958/104-0589531-0675160">Marooned
in RealTime</a></cite> and even earlier in Clarke's <cite><a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0345347951/qid=1112478466/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/104-0589531-0675160">Childhood's
End</a></cite>, amongst others; and the inference <em>IF AI THEN super-human
AI</em> was obvious enough that I recall articulating it in discussions in
student days, 15 years before Vinge's essay, though in the interim the most
obvious change was that internetworked computational power became cheap and
ubiquitous enough for the raw materials to be obvious.</p>

<p>On the other front, compared with the development of superhuman
intelligences from scratch, there is the idea of amplifying existing natural
intelligence. This could be by simple prosthetics such as <a
href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> to direct upgrades to processing
power through biotechnological means.</p>

<h3>So the Singularity is inevitable, and we may only have fine control over
it?</h3>

<p>No &#x2014; we may manage to destroy the technological infrastructure
(war, ecological catastrophe, plague &#x2014; the usual suspects, really);
but if we don't&#x2026;</p>

<p>And we already have overt groups like the <a
href="http://www.singinst.org/">Singularity Institute</a> who are trying to
turn the Singularity into a <a
href="http://www.singinst.org/why-singularity.html">self-fulfilling
prophecy</a>, and to make it manifest in the least worst possible form, where
the transhuman AI created is &#x201c;Friendly&#x201d;, i.e. humane by
choice.</p>

<p>Doesn't this start to sound a lot like the attempts to control the form of
the Third Impact, an event seen as inevitable by NERV and SEELE alike in
NGE?</p>

<h3>Whispers of the Singularity</h3>

</blockquote>

<p>This, in <a
href="http://www.evacommentary.org/episode-02/episode-02A-scene2.html">episode
2</a> of the show (though the ADV subtitling translated it as <em>Human
Enhancement Project</em>; and also present in the intro montage) was enough
to make me sit up and take notice, even before Third Impact was mentioned.
Were they really trying to build something super-human? Was this more than
just a coming-of-age story with giant robots?</p>

<h3>Surviving the Superhuman</h3>

<p>As the possibility of the Singularity taking place within our lifetimes if
it happens at all is high, we need to consider what survival of our current
human selves might mean. The spectrum is large, from unaltered humans being
kept as pets by some fraction of the godlike intellects that we have spawned,
to actually becoming superhuman (or part of one) ourselves.</p>

<p>In the world of strong AI, where machine intelligence is equivalent to
human, it becomes reasonable to consider the person as program; just needing
to be installed on a suitable brain emulator &#x2014; a process known as
uploading (if the emulator is at least as fast as the organic brain,
otherwise it's downloading).</p>

<p>There are a number of deep philosophical issues here, such as whether the
persona running on the new hardware is the same person or not &#x2014; but
then are you the same person you were half a lifetime ago? Consciousness
appears to be (as per <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316180661/qid=1112523148/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/104-0589531-0675160">Dennett</a>)
built up long (as much as seconds) after the fact, so if the program feels
like you, is that any different to the you you would be tomorrow in any case?
Of course in the limiting case where the upload takes place one neuron at a
time, incrementally replacing your brain with an emulator, that is no
different to the normal process whereby our brains change with time.</p>

<p>Then, once installed on a substrate in which it can perform direct
self-modification, the human consciousness could itself bootstrap to the
superhuman; though in doing so it would inevitably have to cut away some of
the dross that has built up in a randomly evolved mentality.</p>

<p>Actually, this is something that we might want to do even without the
buildup to super-humanity &#x2014; <a
href="http://paradise-engineering.com/">hedonic engineering</a>, to remove
the burden of suffering, for example; and without the negatives inferred from
a protective <a href="http://www.online-literature.com/aesop/aesops-fables/31/">sour grapes</a>
mindset in Huxley's <cite><a href="http://www.huxley.net/">Brave New
World</a></cite>.</p>

<p>OK, so we have a state where we can transfer a living human consciousness
to another hardware platform &#x2014; but with unlimited superhuman brains
working on the problem what more can we do?</p>

<p>As medical technology has advanced, we have been able to revive people who
in an earlier day would have been given up for dead, primarily by restarting
their hearts. And those people have been indisinguishable from the way they
were before, assuming the revival was prompt enough that the brain was not
organically damaged by oxygen lack. Degenerative brain diseases aside, it
seems likely that the neuronal replacement model canbe applied to those who
are somewhat dead, just so long as it is possible to work backwards from the
current state to the active person. The limit at which such retrodiction can
be performed, due to the nature of decay and entropy, is referred to as <a
href="http://www.homoexcelsior.com/omega.db/datum/cryopreservation/information-theoretical_death/158">information
theoretical death</a>.</p>

<p>For fictional treatments of uploads (in the absence of superhuman
intelligences) <a href="http://gregegan.customer.netspace.net.au/">Greg
Egan</a> is your man (his novels <cite><a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/006105481X/qid=1112483008/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/104-0589531-0675160">Permutation
City</a></cite>, and <cite><a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/006107344X/qid%3D1112483039/sr%3D11-1/ref%3Dsr%5F11%5F1/104-0589531-0675160">Schild's
Ladder</a></cite>, in particular &#x2014; though beware, the latter is Hard
SF in the sense of hard==difficult, being based on some deep quantum gravity
research he's been involved in).</p>

<p></p>

<h3>What sort of superhuman?</h3>

<p>God &#x2014; or at least the Deus Futurus ex Machina &#x2014; alone
knows.</p>

<p>One benign situation would be where the superhuman intelligence acts as
neutral and fair arbiter for all the human intelligences within its scope;
the so-called SysOp scenario, where the superintelligence serves as an
&#x201c;operating system&#x201d; for all the matter in the Solar System or
beyond, a sort of living peace treaty with the power to enforce itself, ready
to do whatever the &#x201c;inhabitants&#x201d; ask so long as it does not
infringe on any other's rights. In its iteractions with merely human
intelligences, it would need some form of interlocutor &#x2014; a r&#xf4;le
akin to bodhisattva, one who could ascend, but pauses to assist others. In
the jargon, this sort of entity is a Transition Guide, the bridge between
modern-day humanity and the other side of a Friendly Singularity.</p>

<p>Now it is likely in scenarios where the not-yet-superhuman AI achieves
superhumanity by feedback to improve its own operation (recursive
self-improvement), that there will be a hard takeoff, the scenario in which a
mind makes the transition from prehuman or human-equivalent intelligence to
strong transhumanity or superintelligence over the course of days or even
just hours.</p>

<p>Is this all starting to sound familiar?</p>

<h3>Third Impact &#x2014; a hard-takeoff SysOp Event</h3>

<p>Bootstrapped from the nigh-Transcendent metabiotechnology of the precursor
civilisation that created the Seeds of Life, Adam and Lilith, the events we
see in EoE seem to fit this model.</p>

<p>At its core, Giant Naked Rei, being a fusion of Adam and Lilith, Rei, and
whatever parts of Ikari Yui were incorporated into her, is the suddenly
emergent Transhuman Intelligence. The hordes of lesser Reis, manifesting as
the <a href="TGMaya.jpg">most beloved</a> of each of the characters (in <a
href="TGAoba.jpg">most cases</a>) are the transition guides.</p>

<p>In this case, the upload is not a voluntary thing (the scenario is not
100% Friendly by necessity); and it is no different from the early involutary
subsumption by superintelligences in Greg Bear's <cite><a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743444965/qid=1112525545/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/104-0589531-0675160">Blood
Music</a></cite>.</p>

<p>There are, of course, some differences from the true SysOp scenario, in
that there is a privileged human at the controls, and one who does not meet
the definition of Friendliness ( &#x201c;Nobody wants me. So, everybody just
die.&#x201d;), though GNR as quasi-SysOp questions this command repeatedly,
he has an overriding say in what transpires, including commanding the system
to crash and burn, regardless of any other mentalities.</p>
