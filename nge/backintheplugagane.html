      <p>&#8220;It is a dvd plaer and i hav some japanese cartoons.&#8221; he sa

      </p>
      <p>&#8220;cartoons are all cats and meeses and ducks that speak funny. they are for ickle prety kiddies,&#8221; i
        sa.

      </p>
      <p>&#8220;these hav giant <em>robots</em> and wizard xplosions and,&#8221; he lower his dulcet tones, hem hem, to
        a horse whisper and sa &#8220;and <em>gurls</em> all of whom look like <em>Sabrina</em>.&#8221;

      </p>
      <p>&#8220;Sa more, o clot.&#8221;

      </p>
      <p>he sho me one of the disks and it look like no cartoon i hav ever seen.

      </p>
      <p>&#8220;watch,&#8221; he sa, and soon i am staring rapt at the screen.</p>

      <div class="insetl" style="text-align: center; border: black 1px solid; background: #eee; color:inherit">
        <img height="185" width="197" src="angel.png" alt="" title="" />
        <p>an angel, not like<br />any found in div</p>
      </div>


      <p>he is right about the wizard xplosions, but he hav not said 0 about the <em>angels</em> who look nothing like
        any in div, or that the hero is a wet and a weed and a gurly who make fotherington-tomas look intreppid and that
        is saing a lot. and did he really do <em>that</em> in the gurls room? he is an oik and a cad and i diskard him.

      </p>
      <p>Then, just as we are about to get to the big fight, where the <em>gurl</em> who is tuogher than Ermintrude
        (winner of the mrs joyful prize for country dancing and freestyle wrestling for 5 consekutiv years) is about to
        save the da, it stop.</p>


      <div class="insetr" style="text-align: center; border: black 1px solid; background: #eee; color:inherit">
        <img height="95" width="188" src="ermintrude.png" alt="" title="" />
        <p>Ermintrude, winner of the<br />mrs joyful prize for<br />country dancing and<br />freestyle wrestling</p>
      </div>

      <p>&#8220;is that it? what happen next?&#8221; i ask. this is worse than having to wait for the next eppisode when
        noble brave ect dan dare hav been captured by the evil <em>treens</em>

      </p>
      <p>he hav another disk, but before we can start watching, the beke arrive and whisk us all off to the dorm and
        lights out.

      </p>
      <p>that night as i slepe, perchance to dreme (w shakspere, hem hem) i cannot stop wondereing what happen next.</p>

      <hr />

      <p>&#8220;wake up. stand up. bow. sit.&#8221;

      </p>
      <p>i open my eyes and i am in klass!

      </p>
      <p>i bow as the old beke toter in, then look around in horror. yes, it is i, ikari shinji, goriller of klass 2a,
        and i am sitting with my grate friend kensuke who hav a face like a squished tomato and touji, who hav et vast
        ammounts of <em>tuck</em>, radio malt, skool sossages, prunes ect. it is really just like st custards.

      </p>
      <p>but hark, who is this who skip litely towards me, saing &#8220;hello clouds, hello sky, hello evas, hello
        angels&#8221; i do not think, a frown upon her usually radiant countenance, hem hem?

      </p>
      <p>it is soryu asuka langley, of corse.

      </p>
      <p>&#8220;thou utter weed and clot,&#8221; she sa, &#8220;do you kno 0? did you not here the alert.&#8221;

      </p>

        up.&#8221;</p>

      <hr />

      <p>NERV HQ is full of lifts that go whoosh and conveyor belts that go whirr whirr zoom and bring us to where
        <em>Misato</em> wait with picturs of the angel. as she sho us the photos, and tell us her plan my hart fill with
        dread. it look like <em>Sigismund</em> the mad maths master hav sent one of his crack rhombohedrons after us.
      </p>

      <div class="insetl" style="text-align: center; border: black 1px solid; background: #eee; color:inherit">
        <img height="229" width="226" src="sigismund.png" alt="" title="" />
        <p>Sigismund<br />the mad maths master<br />musters his rhomboids</p>
      </div>

      <p>but i cannot sa so not in front of all these gurls &amp; pretend i am the noble valiant dan dare and
        &#8220;pappy&#8221; i sa.

      </p>
      <p>&#8220;i will uterly tuogh it up, and you need do 0, o weedy clot&#8221; sa asuka. rei sa 0 as per ushual

      </p>
      <p>the lifts go whoosh and the conveyor belts go whirr whirr zoom, and we are all soon at the controls of our
        evas. launch sa <em>Misato</em> and with a ka-chung ka-chung zoosh we are standing ready to face the angel.

      </p>
      <p>i diskover that piloting a giant robot is easy-peasy. i just hold on to the handle bars and walk, just like
        gran and her zimmer frame, and nerely as dangerous.

      </p>
      <p>we see the angel in the distance and i draw my progressiv knife and charge ta-ran-ta-ra!

      </p>
      <p>asukas luvly voice hem hem come on the line. &#8220;mind yore feet o clumsiest of clots.&#8221; it is as bad as
        country dancing lessons with Ermintrude.

      </p>
      <p>&#8220;you hav trodden on the skool!&#8221; she sa. she is a swot and this do not plese her, tho any noble boy
        will cheer hip-hip hurrah &#8212; and we mite even get a half day from this!</p>

        <img height="158" width="150" src="asukam.png" alt="" title="" />
        <p>asuka is a swot<br />and a sneke</p>
      </div>

      <p>&#8220;boy,&#8221; sa the commander, who sound just like <em>Grimes</em> the headmaster, &#8220;for wanton
        destruction of skool property, take 1000000 lines and report to my study for the <em>kane</em>.&#8221; being a
        giant robot pilot is not what it is cracked up to be chiz, chiz.

      </p>
      <p>but it is too late for that. i approach the rhombohedron and it open a vast angle A, and i do not hav the ruler
        and kompass i nede to bisekt it. i trip, i tarry (peotry, hem hem) and plumet into its depths.

      </p>
      <p>i am plunged into darkness filled with terrible flickering immages it is just like the late sho at the local
        roxy, my dere.

      </p>
      <p>but soft, what is that awful visage i see? who is that who blub like an ickle prety babe? it is in fakt i, the
        person behind the noble, fearless, brave ect pilot.

      </p>
      <p>&#8220;no!&#8221; i cry &#8220;no! take it away!&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;hush, o grate clot,&#8221; he sa. it is peason standing by my bed in his jim-jams. &#8220;you hav woken
        the whole dorm with yore shouting. it is a wonder none of the bekes hav heard and come up in a bate.&#8221;

      </p>
      <p>i lie back in bed with relief. toda i only hav latin prep and an algy test to worry about.
