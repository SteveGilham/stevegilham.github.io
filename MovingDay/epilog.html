      <p>The Clan Wolf is one of the few surviving feudal houses of
        the <a href="annot.html#outreach">Human Outreach</a>. Founded on
        Lindisfarne (Tau Ceti III) by the Lady Surveyor Trixy Linda of Wolf (see
        also Human Outreach &#8212; Folktales; The Madwoman of Lindisfarne) in 2133 <a href="annot.html#ADT">ADT</a>, it
        has survived basically unchanged to the
        present.</p>

      <h2 class="faded">History.</h2>

      <p class="faded">During the period of preliminary survey of Lindisfarne, it
        was considered necessary to construct citadels to which the colonists could
        withdraw during the <a href="annot.html#Lindisfarne">harsh winters</a>,
        before suitable environmental control could be established. Trixy Wolfe, as
        she was then known, is supposed to have likened them to Mediaeval Castles,
        and then coerced the other surveyors into setting up a <a href="annot.html#feudal">feudal society</a>, where
        they would be the
        nobility. Though recent findings place the responsibility with Mark of
        Connors, it is likely that Ms. Wolfe supported him.</p>

      <p class="faded">After nearly a century, while most of the noble houses had
        relinquished all but nominal sovereignty, Clan Wolf persisted in a firm and
        often cruel government. Attempts were made to depose the clan by force, but
        all were brutally crushed at Trixy's behest. These repressions caused the
        situation to deteriorate, until the eventually successful coup led by
        Matthew Hayward erupted.</p>

      <p class="faded">The majority of the Clan, and the remainder of Clan Connors
        fled the world, to the HR 5568 system, where there was known to be a
        borderline habitable world, surveyed but not yet colonized. They arrived
        but a fortnight before the colony ships from earth, armed with the
        equipment that would subdue the world. They moved on again as soon as their
        task was done, their prior experience of a cold world no longer required,
        before those who feared tyrannical excesses could expel them.</p>

      <p class="faded">They had tired of cold and wintry worlds. Warm and summery <a
          href="annot.html#Luthien">Luthien</a> was their goal, seventy lites further
        from Sol, the news less than a year before passed to them alone the relays
        of the <a href="annot.html#webofman">Web of Man</a>. But though they fled,
        their infamy still remained. Those who had feared them claimed victory,
        that the Clan, guilty, had fled justice.</p>

      <p class="faded">On Luthien, the Clan, among others, formed the Five Castles
        Combine, and the article on the Combine gives a more detailed history of
        this period. Suffice it to say that the eventual colonists challenged the
        Combine's right under the new Linkers' Guild to govern the world. Matthew
        Hayward's ghost seemed to rise to rally the forces of unrest against them
        there, and on Heartward, Toehold and Last Gasp.</p>

      <p style="color:#000;background-color:transparent;font-style:italic">
        Most recently Clan and Combine were resident on Wyvern, their
        seventh world. Their policy of intensive preservation of the planet was
        opposed by interests outside the Combine that preferred a more aggressive
        approach, and certain corporations are known to have supplied aid to
        certain paramilitary Haywardist groups, and have then gone on to buy
        heavily in Wyvern stocks.</p>

      <p style="color:#000;background-color:transparent;font-style:italic">
        As a result of the political pressure applied, the Clan has
        left Wyvern, and despite some minor frictions with the Linkers' Guild, have
        received sponsorship to settle Cimmaron, a world newly autonomous under the
        Guild. It is hoped that this change of policy, in migrating to a
        post-frontier planet will ease tensions and prevent further forced
        migrations.</p>

      <h2 class="faded">Customs</h2>

      <p class="faded">Following Trixy Linda's ideal of a master-race the vast
        majority of the clan are female, ectogenic clones <a href="annot.html#nipped">nipped</a> to display silver hair
        and eyes, grey
        blood and skin. Within this pattern, only height and build vary ; it is
        difficult for an outsider easily to distinguish them. Their feudal past
        shows in the variety of <a href="annot.html#ritual">ritualized titles and
          observances</a> persisting to this day&hellip;</p>
