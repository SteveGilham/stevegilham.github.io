    <p>But initial elation tuned to disappointment as she saw the drop
      completed, having lasted all of two seconds before its overwhelming
      by her own cynicism. Help now was no closer than it had been all
      through this madness of evening, only a hundred yards away &#8212; thirty
      seconds dash, even with stairs to climb in between.
      Unfortunately, it was about as accessible as the centre of a
      planet.</p>

    <p>Uncomfortable phenomena known as enemy lines lay between her and
      rescue and the rather high probability of detection and capture
      that would be involved in crossing them made any attempt to reach
      her rescuers close to potentially fruitless, defeating all the
      object of the exercise.</p>

    <p>She did not have the time to waste on idle regrets of what might
      have been if the rescue had been carried out with just a little
      more finesse delaying their arrival sufficiently much that her
      message could be relayed. Then she could have been picked up from a
      rooftop without fuss or fight. Now that message could prove more of
      a liability to her as any movement would be copied by the matts,
      and would be in great force.</p>

    <p>Reluctantly she discarded all hope of help from the force at the
      eye of that hurricane of combat. She sketched out a worst case
      projection of what might happen, that her message intercepted or
      deduced by the matts would bring the whole hunt after her, so would
      try her own independent escape. There was at least Alan, still at
      the University, whom she had set up against such an eventuality,
      but there were other of her friends who were still in residence.
      Some of them, which would be fortunate for her, even had their own
      aircars with them, aircars which could be borrowed for the half
      hour flight to sanctuary at the Guild port. Those without transport
      &#8212; well, they might at least provide some help &#8212; at the very least,
      she might be able to acquire enough make-up and a change of clothes
      to hide her all too distinctive appearance.</p>

    <p>Enough of time-wasting. Though she was for the moment safe, it
      would not remain that way, and she had best capitalise on that
      asset. Abandoning caution in favour of speed, she trotted out into
      the corridor, and turned right, accelerating to a sprint. Her
      footfalls cracked on the hard tiles of the uncarpeted corridor, and
      in its emptiness, rang out loud, too loud, she felt, to go totally
      unnoticed with people so close by. The corner approached, turning
      only left past the occupied offices.</p>

    <p>She fought to override the animal panic that held her to the
      run, forcing herself to walk slowly and calmly down tthe corridor,
      as if she had every innocent reason to be there. It was hard to
      cease her gasping for breath against future need, and to do so felt
      like self-strangulation, but when she turned the corner, she walked
      quietly as if nothing at all was amiss.</p>

    <p>No more than fifty yards long, the corridor ahead of her seemed
      to reach out for miles. Eight of the doors showed light through
      their windows, eight places, at least eight people who might notice
      her. Had she been of the opinion it might help, Nancy would have
      been thinking small and insignificant at the top of her mind, and
      for every inch of that journey. Lacking that faith, however, she
      must needs walk on without any such aid, and glance cautiously into
      each room as she passed, so as to know on the instant if her
      presence had been noticed.</p>

    <p>Much to her surprise, work, of all things, seemed to be under
      way in two of them &#8212; or at least one of them. In that one, a lone
      student was writing confidently in great sweeping pen-strokes &#8212; the
      other held a group engaged in earnest discussion at a board, but
      she could not make out what the subject was they discussed &#8212; it
      might equally be some diagram of game play.</p>

    <p>Apart from these exceptions, things were proceeding much as she
      had expected &#8212; the occupants of the rooms were to be seen staring
      out of windows, or into blank display screens, with, where this
      could be determined, expressions signifying the agonies of a
      failure of inspiration. In one of the rooms, work was clearly not
      even under consideration; of five occupants, four were engaged in
      some card game, while the last sat to one side, eating sandwiches,
      and reading.</p>

    <p>Yet in all this, there was some pervading sense of wrongness, of
      strangeness never seen before. It was as if she watched this place
      through someone else's eyes, and felt their reaction. She might
      have inclined to put it down to shock, but though she might have
      escaped grave harm at the mercy of the artifact she wore, it seemed
      to her that she had not entirely gone unscathed, and that something
      new to her had been planted, and was taking root, a personality
      whose original was megayears dead, come once again to life.</p>

    <p>The thought did not panic her, indeed could not &#8212; she had been
      terrified all evening, and there was no way for her to respond to
      further stimulus. All that mattered to her was that she get out,
      and find somewhere to rest for a long time. She was just incredibly
      weary, washed out, and needing replenishment.</p>

    <p>Intellectually, she a realized, with cold precision, that her
      legal status here was a violation of neutrality, in as much as she
      had called for troops. It had seemed a good idea at the time, but
      now&#8230; Though she had lived in the University, and came of a
      family that had close ties with the Guild, she knew little of the
      tenor of the justice they meted out, of how much was law, strict
      and by the book, and how much was tempered with compassion.</p>

    <p>She would not give herself up, even though the off-chance might
      be a safe bet &#8212; her stupid pride would not let her. Instead, she
      would show everyone and win her way home again.</p>

    <p>She had reached a junction. To her left, the corridor went
      through a more densely occupied region &#8212; ahead it reached out as a
      catwalk across a large hall, and then into another corridor. She
      chose the way ahead.</p>

    <p>The light in the hall came from windows set high in the right
      hand wall, and in tongues of yellow light pouring from corridors on
      the level below. The roof was ten feet above her head, so near, and
      yet so far.</p>

    <p>At the sound of voices, she stopped and crouched down, reckoning
      the elevation of the catwalk sufficient to hide her from casual
      observers &#8212; but she readied her guns, just in case. Thew voices
      came from below her, and to her left, and were approaching the
      hall. She thought she recognized one of the voices. Safe in her
      concealment, she watched from that vantage point for them to come
      into sight.</p>

    <p>As she had hoped, she did indeed recognize one of them, small,
      of feline stock, and heavily maned. Apart from his companion, a
      female of some avian species, there was no other person to be seen,
      or within earshot.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Hey! Althan!&#8221; she called down to him.</p>

    <p>He looked up.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Nancy? What the hell are you doing here?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Hiding, escaping. Do you have a car somewhere nearby I can
      borrow? I'll buy a new one, if needs be.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Sorry, I walked here &#8212; beyond the obvious, are you in
      trouble?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Yes &#8212; there's a whole gang of matts and a couple of squads of
      clan grunts having a fire-fight a couple of hundred yards away, and
      if they don't get me, then the Linkers will. Good-bye &#8212; and
      sorry.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Althan and his companion collapsed under a spray of stunner fire
      &#8212; they would stay that way for ten or fifteen minutes, long enough
      for her to be well clear. Nancy did not look back as she went, only
      forwards to note the doors from under which light showed, where she
      must tread softly as she passed. In one room, a faint whirring
      noise indicated some mechanism working at speed, but all the others
      were silent behind their anonymous doors.</p>

    <p>Ahead, the corridor split into a T-junction, with dim light
      reflecting in uneven patterns from the semi-gloss finish of the
      wall. There was a door half in view to the right, and next to it, a
      fire extinguisher, red against the prevailing grey-green colour
      scheme. Following her earlier choice to turn right, she turned
      right again, determined to deviate from the course she had
      previously transmitted that she would follow.</p>

    <p>She sought stairs &#8212; anything to change levels, up or down. This
      building seemed to oppress her, close her in. Her mind felt trapped
      in her skull, helpless to extend itself beyond the barrier of
      bone.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, there was a tension in the air, as if it had become
      ten degrees warmer and sixty percent more humid, and it clung and
      cloyed about her. Sweat was on her brow, and her body damp. Her
      armpits were chill with evaporation. There was a scent of musk, and
      other heavier, deeper or darker fragrances that she could discern,
      but put no name to, and she knew it was her own terror that she
      smelt.</p>

    <p>She walked, did not run, and she knew that the air temperature
      here was maintained at 290K, with a humidity of 35% &#8212; and despite
      that, she was sweating like a pig, and probably the headache she
      now had was related to that. From her reading, she guessed it to be
      a fever, though how she had caught such a thing, where, and from
      whom, was a mystery. The whole concept of illness, beyond digestive
      upset from over-indulgence, was something she had always before
      regarded as something out of the unclean pages of history.</p>

    <p>She was, however, not totally ignorant of the subject, and knew
      that in cases of fever, crude and direct lowering of the body
      temperature had been used in the treatment, and also that were she
      to keep on like this, she would most likely suffer from thermal
      overload. She mopped her brow with one hand, and the skin burned at
      the touch. The sweat left a greasy stain on her flank where she
      wiped the hand clean on her coveralls. She opened the front zip
      about halfway from throat to waist, and felt the air touch icily on
      the open skin. She needed out, now, out where the air was at least
      five, maybe ten, kelvin cooler, just to escape the tropical
      atmosphere here.</p>

    <p>Help? did she need help now? But whose? Anything that helped,
      she would accept. She could see stairs, about a thirty yards ahead,
      but dared not, could not, hurry to them, when the air wrapped her
      like a heavy blanket. She needed a thermometer, to satisfy her
      curiosity as to exactly what temperature she was running.</p>

    <p>She balanced haste against stealth, and decided to break into a
      jog, that grew into a dash as she reached the stairs.</p>

    <p>Her momentum carried her up the first flight in two strides, and
      she swung around on the bannister there to get what advantage she
      could maintain for the next. It was shorter, only four steps, and
      she took it in two strides as well, and at walking pace, was on the
      next level. Before the effects of trying to maintain such a pace
      set in, she continued the climb at a punishing fast walk that made
      her thighs and calves ache with the strain and the build-up of
      lactic acid.</p>

    <p>The next level was the top, and the stairs up had that familiar,
      indefinable, but definite air about them that always signified the
      hardly used ways used only for service access. At the top of the
      last stairs was a structure just large enough to call a hut or
      cabin, with a landing at the top of the flight, extending above the
      previous one. The door was at the end of that, and separated from
      the open stairwell by a handrail.</p>

    <p>Nancy waited by the door, and listened. The door was warped, and
      split darkly down the middle, and fitted only approximately in is
      frame. A chill breeze filtered through the cracks, and the
      ring-light showed through the same apertures. Its cool was welcome,
      but not enough to relieve Nancy's feeling that she radiated a
      conspicuous amount of heat. Getting up above the windbreak of the
      buildings might make her a glaring target to infrared, but she
      craved the chill air.</p>

    <p>Now near the outside, she could hear the sounds of battle above
      the whistling notes of the night air as it forced its way in to
      her. Occasionally &#8212; every five or ten seconds &#8212; there came the
      noise of shots. After the initial fling, the fire-fight was going
      the way of all fire-fights that there had ever been, with the Clan
      troops now well dug in, and both sides only shooting when someone
      moved too close to the edges of concealment, and then it might just
      be one round expended in token.</p>

    <p>The smouldering stage the battle had reached brought Nancy most
      anxiety. She knew how easily a group of three or four people,
      moving in concealment from vantage point to vantage point could
      mimic the presence of a whole platoon for quite a while, before the
      opponents realized that anything was amiss &#8212; more than enough for
      the rest of the platoon to withdraw, and move to encircle or
      retreat. Tonight, with both sides seeking her amidst the sprawl of
      buildings, both would be trying as soon as they felt it to be
      possible to deceive the other. Neither would be deceived, but each
      had to try to disengage some forces, in case the other also
      succeeded. And with everything played by standard doctrine, and
      with the likely intelligence available to either side, it would
      behoove her to get as far away as she could from where she had
      intended to be.</p>

    <p>She pushed the door open a fraction. It creaked a little in
      protest, but as soon as it was clear of the frame, it was quiet. No
      people, or shadows to indicate their presence. She opened the door
      fully, and stepped out. There was no mocking voice, no gunshot, to
      greet her. The wind was alone, blowing cold where it could reach.
      The expanse of roof before her was empty of movement or the shapes
      of people, and a taller building intruded between her and the
      museum.</p>

    <p>Nancy turned left, continuing on the path she had set for
      herself, where the roof opened up for her into a road of harsh
      white running without turn or deviation for at least a hundred
      yards. She would have to take it in straight sprinting to minimize
      her time of vulnerability on a roof singularly lacking in cover,
      and also to build up her lead against the time when even a score of
      yards could tip the scales between reaching final cover, and
      capture.</p>

    <p>She ran with all the speed she could muster, a small fleet
      figure, hard to see in the cold grey light, camouflaged so that her
      shadow was more visible than her reality. Her feet rasped on the
      rough surface, her breath coming in long gasps, and her arms
      swinging furiously. There was only the long restrained imperative
      to move, to reach her immediate goal.</p>

    <p>And the keening of the wind, shrill around the buildings,
      fluting from any opportune projection, in its sounds, she caught
      once again the thread of the blivit's note, and remembered once
      more its triumphant elfin song. The sound grew, became fleshed out,
      louder and deeper, and its timbre far more resonant. It was a song
      now, and not a note or melody, for all that it lacked words. It was
      wild, and earthy, born of bursting untamed life in its steady round
      of seasons, powerful and irresistible.</p>

    <p>The song was taken up from other quarters, by the deep tolling
      of bells that seemed to originate from the depths of the planet
      below, as if that mass of rock and magma had been struck and set
      vibrating at some overtone. She had heard such, through some
      manipulation of the recordings of seismic traces, as masses were
      dropped onto dead, airless moons, but the sound she heard now was
      not so crude as that. It was the planet itself joining in the song,
      adding its own voice to the chorus as it proclaimed the mastery of
      life over the unliving, of blood, breath and the good earth over
      dead dry rock.</p>

    <p>The great bells echoed and re-echoed about her, as if the
      heavens, night dark beneath the soaring rings, gave back that sound
      as it bounced around inside the cold black dome.</p>

    <p>Filling the spectrum from the infra-basses of the earth-bells,
      and the screaming trebles of the night air, it was a whole host, a
      forest, of sounds, like flames or blades of emerald grass. Terrible
      and beautiful, the faerie choirs and orchestras, the great bells
      and bass organ pipes, together the drowned out the rest of the
      world.</p>

    <p>Nancy stumbled as she ran, overcome by this sudden suspension of
      reality, this rush of beauty from a night of ugliness. It surpassed
      anything she had dreamed of, and far more, anything she had ever
      expected to experience. Some quiet part of her, not yet caught up
      and washed away by the streaming, roaring, flamelike splendour
      noticed, unsurprisedly, coldly, that tears streamed now freely down
      her face. The beauty of it broke down barriers she had set herself,
      barriers that kept all of the deep emotions, the dark and powerful
      feelings, guarded far inside her, lest through them she became
      vulnerable to hurt. The surge of release, as she experienced all
      these things that she had believed that she would never safely be
      able to experience, lifted her away in the pyre of green and blue
      fire that rose around her.</p>

    <p>That fire was, or became, her, and she flowed in the flames that
      burned awesomely in the darkness, and she too was the song, a glory
      in a world too long silent, a song that would &#8212; must &#8212; rouse the
      whole world of nature and bring it into harmony. Her body, a husk
      both limited and physical was, in that timeless splendor, so small
      a thing, and of so little true worth, that she felt she could
      ignore it in preference to her communion with the wild and the
      growing things, its sisterhood of blood and breath.</p>

    <p>As if from above, she noticed the battle fought for the
      possession of her, but only in passing, an insignificant episode in
      the vast tapestry of life. Though she knew little poetry, and that
      which she did was usually limited to single lines of phrases, out
      of her scattered repetoire one sprang to mind, a line, she thought,
      from Tennyson, that captured the moment &#8212; what is it all, but the
      troubling of ants in the glare of a million million suns? It was a
      small darkening of the flame, one speck of soot, one dark thread in
      the tapestry, one half heard discord in the song of life.</p>

    <p>Fuelled from the reserves of her self that she had opened to it,
      the flame burned up, more radiant, it seemed, deeper and hotter. It
      had started as green as the grass, but the flecks and threads of
      green drifted away, their sources burned out, and the true flame
      was revealed. Blue it was, more intense and more pure than she had
      ever seen, and infinitely deep. It was the real colour, to which
      the alien gem was but a mere approximation, a half-hearted fake,
      masking the reality, rather than revealing it. Its song, more than
      the roaring of mundane fire, grew with its light, rising towards
      crescendo. It reached to heights of transcendence beyond the
      imagination, powered by mighty organ notes, and the throbbing of
      great bells, driven by the voices that freely poured forth the
      wordless song, ranging from deepest bass to inaudible treble.</p>

    <p>As listener, rather than participant, the song would have
      brought Nancy to tears many times over, for the joys it brought her
      in her drabness, and for the balancing sorrow that played
      counterpoint, that together were so bitter-sweet, heart-rending.
      She was feeling now, in those few instants, more emotions, and more
      deeply than any before &#8212; save perhaps hate, and fear, and anguish
      of regret. There had been those things, composing her life in
      crimson. black and umber, but now there was blue, like sky or
      tropic sea.</p>

    <p>Tears there would have been, for other more mundane reasons. To
      hear the song but once would be to remember only partially, and
      only the most distorted fragments that could but hint at the
      reality they would be drawn from &#8212; and even that ghost fragment
      would have been trapped there. Untrained, without specific design,
      she was unable to communicate non-verbal sound to any other being,
      and with that awesome word of song forever locked within her, she
      would surely have lost what last holds on sanity she yet
      retained.</p>

    <p>The climax came, but only after a build-up that seemed to endure
      for &aelig;ons. It exploded in terrible splendour of brightness,
      spreading out from the very heart of her being. It did not come as
      the total disintegration of ego into that external flow of fire,
      and breath, that surge of untamed and unbounded ecstasy, that would
      suffuse the Universe, to and beyond its ultimate heat death, an
      annihilation that she had expected, had feared, and had secretly
      hoped for as an end to this pantomime. Instead, it seemed, the goal
      of the entire spectacle was a firmer integration of her identity,
      on a level above its previous structuring. The concept of a
      harmonic to her original consciousness was how she herself, still
      dispassionate, chose to regard it. Whatever it might be named, the
      fire and song were now hers to command and the merest of whims, and
      she drew their strengths about her like a cloak, a mantle of power
      sublime, beside which even the powers her civilization could wield
      were but feeble beginnings.</p>

    <p>The night was crisp, its blacks and whites and shades of silver
      delineated to impossible sharpness, but as if by knife-edges of
      monolayer thickness. On the air were scents, too many, too subtle
      and unfamiliar for her even to distinguish, let alone begin to name
      them.</p>

    <p>In this wondrous night, beneath the sky, following the finely
      etched pattern of debris swarms orbiting above, Nancy walked, a
      tall, and beautiful and imperial figure, ethereal, but with a
      terrible and insistent solidarity about her. Her height was not a
      thing of meters and their fractions, but borne of a sense of
      presence, to make her tower tens of centimetres above any she might
      meet. She was singing, her song a song of great rejoicing, with a
      voice and tongue that were not her own, and all the while, the
      world was singing to itself and to her, in belling tones of
      triumph.</p>

    <p>Nancy was one, an individual, with her own unique identity. yes,
      but a One that brimmed over and poured itself unstintingly over
      everything that lived.</p>

    <p>At her breast, focusing the stream of charisma, the stone that
      had carried this message of divinely human joy down the long and
      empty ages&#8230;she thought that, and immediately there was a picture
      of an endless black corridor through which dead winds whistled.
      That was thirty and more million years, a timespan beyond her
      appreciation. The stone burned starlike, lighting her way in nova
      light, with coronas of indigo and ultramarine.</p>

    <p>Physical azure light surrounded her like a fog, taking on her
      shape, and extending it to godlike proportions, and wafted away
      like mist, ever to be renewed from its source. The shape had eyes,
      and they were hard points of neutral, deep sky blue, flashing
      starlike streamers of light on the optical imperfections of any
      there to see.</p>

    <p>There was one such, and he was no friend to her. Not knowing
      what he saw, or even beginning to guess or comprehend its true
      nature, he was aware that anything he did not know that moved on
      the roof was not his friend, and in the belief that what faced him
      was without the powers of a cybersoldier, he aimed, and fired.</p>

    <p>Like a lance, or arctic gale of winter, sickly purple light
      reached for the demigod figure, and its stream began to wash away
      at the blue aura, and its serpent's hiss seeped into the song of
      life, sowing its discords in the music. In Nancy's mind, and in the
      earth below, the great bells clanked and clattered into silence.
      About her, the choirs faded back into the howling of the wind that
      had engendered them. The song of joy faltered on her lips, and
      ended as the words and tune were washed from her mind. The light
      was extinguished, and she herself diminished.</p>

    <p>There was no longer music in the night, only the sickening
      ugliness of life, with all its stupidities, failures and
      shabbiness. Anything that might have been joyful had been burned
      out in those long seconds of stunner fire.</p>

    <p>She staggered as if heavily drugged, in a shambling and pathetic
      attempt at speed struggling with a body that had recaptured her.
      Nausea filled her, direct and bodily in its origins, and pain,
      things that she had forgotten even the potential existence of. From
      fire, she plunged into cold; from joy, she reaped misery; from
      soaring freedom, she plunged into unwholesome confinement. The
      sweat that dewed her brow was cold now, and her guts felt curdled
      and sour. Dully, she realized that saliva trickled from one corner
      of a mouth gone slack, its sticky stream mingling her tears.</p>

    <p>She sobbed deeply, but was too drained to weep again, and her
      breath bubbled through the aftermath as she fought to clear her
      nose and sinuses. Tears were too special and precious for this
      time.</p>

    <p>The force that had kept her moving through the song motivated
      her still, but now with narrowed aims &#8212; the animal urge for refuge,
      for somewhere to crawl away to, to hide, and to die there
      undisturbed. There was never thought of firing back, without
      knowing a target, or being able to extract suitable revenge, or
      enjoyment, from the deed.</p>

    <p>Her mouth filled with the taste of bile, and her belly churned
      with its own life, shot through with deep anguish at each jolting
      footfall, as if something fermented there. She gasped for breath,
      needing to yawn or belch to relieve that aggravation, but only able
      to such at the air for some tenuous sustenance.</p>

    <p>Only an insignificant time, a mere handful of seconds, passed
      before she gained sanctuary, the first approximately suitable
      location she had found, at the corner of the roof, by an
      air-conditioning installation, closed off to the other long side,
      and one short side, by the edge of the roof, and ten feet by two of
      gravel-set roof where she could lie, and expect not to be seen. She
      felt infinitely wretched, lying curled up for warmth on the cold,
      hard and uncomfortable rooftop. How ironic, after mere minutes ago
      having been overheated to the point of discomfort, to be at the
      mercy of the cold. It sucked what warmth she had away, greedily,
      and without sating. She went into a spasm of shivering and
      chattering of teeth that she had to force away by will. The cold
      wind pushed roughly through her clothing, despite the resealing of
      the zip; and the icy touch of sweat-dampened cloth caressed her
      body uncaringly.</p>

    <p>She waited in profound misery for a resolution of events. In
      these depths of suffering, anything, even the emptiness of death,
      would have sufficed, if only her torment would cease.</p>

    <p>She needed to yawn, she found, and opened her mouth to try, but
      failed. She longed desperately to be sick, to purge herself, to end
      the agony inside her now, and be gone. To hasten matters, and force
      the now inevitable conclusion, she tried to stick fingers down her
      throat, but even the anticipation of briefest touch seemed only to
      lock her body in an indefinable heart stopping rictus, separated
      from her volition.</p>

    <p>She tried again, but only blackness and red against her field of
      vision resulted. Nor could she yawn, despite attempts that seemed
      to dislocate her jaw. She relaxed, to rest a while and try again.
      She looked out over the rooftops.</p>

    <p>There was only a moment's warning, enough time to almost
      involuntarily lunge forwards and hold her head out over the abyss,
      while the contents of her stomach rushed up her gullet.</p>

    <p>She moaned as the warm slurry poured from her mouth to splash
      faintly on the ground below. Its consistency offended her, as if it
      were somehow gritty, or papery. She watched it fall from somewhere
      at the back of her skull; distantly through eyes filmed with tears.
      Without pause to relax, she vomited again, but when she threw
      herself into the next retch, she brought up only a mouthful of bile
      that she had actively to spit out. She let herself tauten into the
      spasms of retching twice more, gurgling in torment each time to
      retrieve a few cubic centimetres, no more, of gooey fluid that
      seemed slightly fizzy. She spat as often as she could, to clear out
      the worst of the taste, with am ought now dried up.</p>

    <p>Weak and exhausted, she lay there for a little while before
      thinking of tidying her self up, blowing her nose to clear whatever
      measure of regurgitation had been misrouted, and wiping saliva and
      vomit from her chin and lips. The smell and taste still clung to
      her, and her stomach's acid burned in her throat, making her teeth
      feel strange, almost pasty soft.</p>

    <p>Sweaty, chilled, and weary, she sat up. She had weathered the
      storm, and was combat ready again. She looked out from her shelter,
      ready indeed for combat. She was angry now, coldly so, and her
      anger was directed at the person who, unknowingly or not, had
      stolen from her all the beauty and glory of life, tearing her down
      from truly living to painfully existing.</p>

    <p>Wistfully she tried to recapture the feeling, build again the
      song and the fire, but it was extinguished. The night had become
      very still, and only a flickering blue flame burned in her mind, a
      tantalizing reminder of what had been destroyed. For the first
      time, she had acquired a reason for her existence, and it had been
      snatched away.</p>

    <p>Nancy drew her stunner, and with cold glee, set the drain to
      maximum and narrowed the beam, until at short range, its touch
      would be lethal. What had been done to her was worse than mere
      death, for she still existed, chilled, with the stench of her vomit
      in her nostrils, its burns in her throat, able dimly to remember
      the transcendent feelings that had been here. From a heaven, she
      had been dragged down into hell, and for that she would see justice
      done, and scrupulously exact her revenge. The only vengeance she
      could bring about to match the crime was the penalty of death,
      without mercy, slowly, and in agony, such as could conveniently be
      caused by a body hit with a full power stunner beam; and even that
      would be insignificant beside what she suffered. They would last
      only minutes, but she would have to endure for an indefinite
      time.</p>

    <p>A figure rose from concealment, away across the skyline, at
      first cautiously, and then, as no fire was directed towards it,
      with growing confidence. It moved towards her, leaving its safety,
      and silhouetting itself against the rings. Nancy let it advance &#8212;
      it was clearly male &#8212; enemy &#8212; and was coming closer, presenting an
      ever growing target. Coldly, calmly, she aimed, until she was
      certain of her hit, and squeezed the trigger. With awesome disdain
      for haste, or so it seemed, a ray of intense purple light reached
      out to touch its target. Nancy watched it splash from and caress
      her victim, like a gentle hand of death. In that instant, she
      understood the expression on the painting she had seen in Tricia's
      room &#8212; and felt her own expression drawn into that maniacal
      grin.</p>

    <p>The figure began to crumple, and Nancy ceased her firing &#8212; it
      was no part of her plan to give, however accidentally, a head shot
      which would kill instantly and without pain. A gun clattered
      quickly to the floor from a relaxed grasp, to be followed by the
      soggy sound of dropped meat. Half gasped moans of agony showed that
      she had achieved her aim.</p>

    <p>Now, while she might still have some of the advantage of
      surprise with her, Nancy vaulted from her shelter, to run. Her
      immediate desire for vengeance was stilled, and her unashamed urge
      to self-preservation now overrode it. Twenty-five meters away, over
      open rooftop, without possibility of cover, a stairway that she had
      half noted earlier. Two to three seconds &#8212; a fast count of five &#8212;
      only. Halfway, while she was out on the naked arena, a stunner beam
      swept past her. Without breaking stride, Nancy wheeled around on
      one foot, bracing against her momentum with the other, and with her
      gun held steady in both hands, she fired.</p>

    <p>Her stronger light reached out, and as it swept by, briefly it
      kissed the source of the weaker. That lesser fire flickered, and
      died as the hands that held it relaxed. Only its last guttering
      spurt touched Nancy, brushed her but only for an instant. On low
      power &#8212; not the killing intensity she had been using &#8212; all it could
      do was cause pins and needles where it touched.</p>

    <p>Enemy fire suppressed, and without hardly ceasing to move, she
      continued her pirouette and accelerated away. So close was the
      stairway, that she was still accelerating to a full sprint as she
      crashed through the door. She rolled onto the floor and landed
      sitting in the far corner, with her stunner pointed down the
      stairs. Thankfully, there was no need to fire it &#8212; as she had
      hoped, she was the first to reach such an out of the way place.</p>

    <p>She picked herself up, and returned to the door, opening it
      carefully, gun first. To her sight, there were five figures,
      unidentifiable, moving on the roof. None, however, were human, and
      that was enough for her. Three of them failed to spot her and try
      for cover in time, and to each one, Nancy extended the blessing of
      purple light and agony.</p>

    <p>With the fall of the last unlucky one, she checked her stunner.
      Ten seconds she had used it, at most fifteen, and almost all of
      that at full drain &#8212; and that had used eighty percent of the
      charge. She lowered the intensity as far as she dared, and then
      turned it up a little. She needed instant results, and she guessed
      that at the new setting, and short range, it would provide her with
      near instant results for fifteen or twenty seconds.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Are my sisters there?&#8221; she called out in formal.</p>

    <p>The only reply was an obscenity. Her worst case estimate had
      proven optimistic. She must have been spotted by a scouting party
      of matts, while their companions were likely still harrying the
      Clan forces who would be following her earlier message in blissful
      ignorance. They were heading north now, and she, east. Homewards,
      she thought, with mild interest, but home was six thousand miles
      away. Six hundred yards would see her safe. She wondered, could she
      have subconsciously betrayed herself like that? The thought was
      idle, irrelevant, and she let it go.</p>

    <p>The roof remained still. As far as she could tell, there were no
      other hunters on the roof, beyond those she had driven to cover,
      not any arriving by visible routes. She could not wait pinned
      there, while a force reached the stairs from inside, and she could
      not flee, for there was no way to secure the door against pursuit.
      Unable to stay, whatever she did, she must depart, and so that
      required her to destroy pursuit. Reluctantly, she drew her second
      gun.</p>

    <p>This was no toy weapon for ladies of delicate up-bringing as the
      stunner had been, but a self-contained, if markedly toned down,
      version of the direct fire weapons of cybersoldier equipment. Its
      touch would maim, if indeed it did not kill outright from shock;
      each cartridge would burn a two-inch hole through steel plate a
      foot thick, and proportionately more through flesh, whoever it
      belonged to.</p>

    <p>She fired one cartridge, pouring out that terrible power at the
      nearer of her pursuers. The beam was invisible, and lasted but an
      instant. All there was to see was a transient glow of ionization,
      and the yellow of concrete that had absorbed some of that energy.
      Sounds there were, however, enough and more than enough to make up
      for the deficiency of visible spectacle.</p>

    <p>Air cracked, whiplike, where it had been displaced, and the
      concrete, thermally stressed, exploded in tiny fragments. The spent
      rod tinkled quietly as it struck the floor, and the person she had
      hit screamed, and gurgled.</p>

    <p>The other hid, but it availed him little. Nancy knew exactly
      where he cowered, behind a vent for the air conditioning. Another
      shot left smooth-edged holes in the aluminium about twelve inches
      above the ground. She had cruelly allowed him that much mercy &#8212; if
      he didn't succumb to systemic shock before help arrived, he would
      live. Meanwhile, he would not be enjoying his situation. The metal
      glowed at first, but soon was quenched, heat sinking into the whole
      structure. She reholstered her gun, but only when satisfied when
      none but the dead and dying remained, and closed the door.</p>

    <p>Nancy took the stairs at the fastest speed she could maintain
      without stumbling and falling, almost skiing or skating down each
      flight. She toyed with the idea of sending a second message, to
      correct the first, but decided that the time she had would be
      better spent in flight.</p>

    <p>That last exchange of fire, however one sided it had been on its
      own, had not been to her advantage. It had slowed her enough for
      others perhaps to find her, and it had been noisy. The sound could
      have been heard easily a hundred yards away through closed windows,
      or rooms that faced away; and there was more than the physical
      noise. The located, intense gravitic effects employed would have
      woken any Linkers in the vicinity, at the instant of firing.</p>

    <p>She did not trust their reaction to this multiple invasion of
      their domain. Of necessity aloof, their neutrality made them at
      best fickle allies, and she dared not hope for a repeat of Linker
      McRae's kindness.</p>

    <p>She was alone on the dark stairs, descending to a ground floor
      that was just as dark and quiet, and though she waited on the last
      landing for a cautious check, there was nothing to beware of. In
      front of her, ring glow spilled through the glass doors of the
      atrium, and in that same light, the pathway beyond was deserted.
      Across the way, and slightly to the left, another set of doors,
      flanked by elaborate ornament, enough to identify for her the
      location, despite it being a place she had rarely frequented.
      Knowing where she was, she began to detail her route of escape.</p>

    <p>Her own chosen habitat, the wide roofs, had become too
      predictable, and now, far too crowded as well. They had served
      their purpose, as a short-cut, but now concealment was as important
      as speed. She bounded down the last stairs, and tried the doors.
      They had been locked, but a nearby window hadn't, and she scrambled
      awkwardly through, to land in the ornamental flower-bed below.</p>

    <p>Ignoring the crushed vegetation, washed of its colours in the
      pallid light, she remained crouched, ready to spring at the
      slightest sound or sight of threat. In front of her, and above, a
      few lights still burned on the upper floors, hopefully signifying
      that the main doors opposite would be unlocked.</p>

    <p>A dash, a couple of instants of painful exposure and
      vulnerability to harm, brought her to the doors, and they parted at
      her touch against them. At a slower pace, to conserve her strength
      for the quarter-mile of open ground that surrounded this
      efflorescence of structure, she turned to her left, to follow a
      corridor from the entry.</p>

    <p>The silence was complete in that empty passageway, and where her
      footsteps broke it, formless flowing thing that it was, it healed
      again in the instant, as good as it had been before. Desertion and
      long neglect seemed to taint the air, a feel of people once there,
      long ago, and now, only their memory, less than a ghost, remained
      to show that they had ever been there. Nancy felt deeply,
      poignantly alone, but quiet with tired resignation. She was crushed
      by the great conspiracy that had been built up against her.
      Linkers, matts, even the clans, seemed to have no other purpose
      than to frustrate her, abandon and persecute her. Her wonted
      melancholy returned, her yearning for true companionship of the
      spirit, a sharing of feelings and thoughts between equals, freely
      given and freely accepted. Anyone &#8212; no, not any one; they would
      have to be psychologically in accord with her. She had said that
      she loved Tricia &#8212; but really they were sisters with too much
      familiarity; and with seemingly different temperaments; Tricia
      would be irritatingly light hearted were she here with her now. But
      then even the incandescent joy of the&#8230; experience of minutes ago
      revolted her.</p>

    <p>What had that been? She could not tell, except that it had been
      centred on the stone she wore, and it had been powerful and
      splendid, bitter-sweet in memory, just like love. Somehow, she
      preferred to hold back in sadness, tormenting herself with the idea
      that such a thing was possible, but not for her, as far as any
      conceivable future ran. If before she had walked in a blue flame of
      emotion, the colour of her reverie was now a deep crimson, the
      colour of dying embers shining on a cloth of regal red. It was too
      deep, too slow moving to be called a flame, and too sombre. It was
      an inversion, a perversion &#8212; as much in the mathematical sense of a
      turning inside-out &#8212; of what she had known, a thing born of the
      stillness of the night and not the song of the wild; born of
      eternal loneliness and not the unity of all things living; a thing
      essentially of herself, and not imposed from outside. Comforted by
      that last, she abandoned many regrets, and surrendered herself to
      it, taking on that cloak of night.</p>

    <p>The corridor ahead branched right. Her eyes noted it, but her
      conscious mind did not concern itself with such trivia. What was
      practically an autopilot system, that she had built up over the
      years, did noticed it, and took it, turning mechanically. Her
      conscious mind began to drift to sleep, now that a continual state
      of battle-readiness seemed unnecessary, aided by her preoccupation
      with her emotional plight.</p>

    <p>In dark perspectives, the corridor diminished into distant
      obscurity before her, and from the formless dark, shapes appeared
      and solidified. Doors, turnings, light fixtures, all emerged from
      nothing, grew and passed. All fell on unseeing eyes. Instead, Nancy
      was seeing, by turns, as her concentration wandered from interest
      to interest, snapshot memory pictures of her route out, as she had
      seen its sections before, at each point guessing the threats that
      might be posed, the counterplays she would have to make. She
      sketched and rehearsed the dialogues she would have with her
      friends when she found them in their rooms, and asked their help.
      Increasingly often, the dull work of second-guessing the future
      took second place to idle musings.</p>

    <p>She remembered Tricia, and their farewell, as a girl so nearly
      the ideal she craved, and so tragically, so minimally flawed.
      Unbidden, as if she had started already to dream, the picture in
      her mind changed. She saw the main command chamber of Upside
      Control, watched the urgent action of those who staffed it. That
      was one of the places where all the action would be most truly
      located, for if it were not the actual site of any event, it would
      be more than likely that the happenings would be guided by the
      wills of those quiet, intent figures. Those there, and others like
      them, in the other centres of political and military power on the
      planet.</p>

    <p>Some were openly declared &#8212; each one of the five castles &#8212; and
      they were the nexi for most of the military manoeuvring; but there
      were more. Whatever the matts, in their various schismatic groups,
      used as high commands, publicly known but secretly located; and the
      public headquarters of organization clandestinely involved &#8212; the
      Free Traders, Shammarra Funding, StarLine, whichever political
      factions had been brought in or bought, motivated by either
      financial or political gains to be made, if only the castles were
      removed.</p>

    <p>And here she was, caught in the middle of it, a pawn with no
      intrinsic powers, unwillingly mixed up in the web of decisions made
      by one of those secret wills, those hidden chess-players, and she
      with only the information of her senses to guide her. She wondered
      at whose final bidding she had been ambushed here. Shammarra,
      perhaps, or Kingarra: either of the directors who had recently
      appeared on Wyvern, just at the time when all their &#8126;side&#8217; could
      use a helping hand? Or just a local cell, motivated by hate for the
      clans, or more abstracted political ideals, whose commander had
      tried to gain prestige from her capture, without the order, or
      possibly without the consent, of higher echelons? There was little
      practical value in sorting back through the chain of command to the
      relevant decision maker. The problem was posed, the question of
      authorship, immaterial. Now, with just what she could see and hear
      to guide her, she must make her play.</p>

    <p>There were doors before her again, these bearing glyphs in white
      on red that declared them to be intended for emergency use only.
      She ignored the admonition, and slipped out through them, almost
      certain she was ahead of the pursuit, if indeed she had not lost
      it.</p>

    <p>Nancy continued south, her path now looped almost into a
      half-circle, taking the path ahead of her, trusting herself to the
      open sky again. Here the light faded into a dusky intermediate
      between the direct glare, and the gloom of unlit outdoors;
      buildings rising high on either side were responsible, hiding a
      major part of the arc of the rings. A few pale shreds of scudding
      cloud moved across the limited view, straggling remnants of the
      overcast that had shielded her arrival at the University.</p>

    <p>A planet, number four in the system, showed yellow near the
      height of the arch, below it to the north. Three stars of first
      magnitude, the vaguest hints of others, were all else in sight in
      the washed out skies of her home.</p>

    <p>Wryly, she remembered her last nocturnal visit to this place. In
      those last swift fifty-odd hours, events, it seemed, had gone full
      circle, save only now that she, and not Ginny, was the person
      hunted. Worse, there was no expedition coming to her location, and
      she was unable to call help without alerting the matts. All that
      she could count as a positive change was the clear sky. If it had
      been raining, as it rained then, it would have been the last straw.
      For all the tactical help it might have offered, she had endured
      misery enough this cheerless night. Full circle? nice as a phrase,
      there were enough changes in the balance of initiative and resource
      to make U-turn more apt.</p>

    <p>To her left, all this while, lay the last barrier between
      herself and the open, a solid length of offices and lecture
      theatres that formed one wall to the complex. Every so often, every
      fifty feet or thereabouts, it sprouted buds, so that from the air
      it would seem like a crude comb for a titan, or a heraldic label of
      many points, a score or so in number. In one bay, between the
      teeth, opposite the closest approach of untamed wild, clansman Dr.
      Peter Brady had his office, and despite his return home, the office
      should have been left, as always, prepared for the passage
      through.</p>

    <p>The place was marked by a thick growth of rhododendron bushes
      along the southern wall, and Nancy hid herself behind the cover of
      their profuse leathery leaves. The smell of the dusty soil was very
      heavy in the still, sheltered air, and the bark of the main stems
      was covered in its fine dust. There were cobwebs and rustling
      sounds of tree lizards disturbed from sleep. Against a wall covered
      in dried soil and dust splashed there in past rain-storms, where
      the rings cast a matching dusty grey light, mottled and shifting,
      she moved slowly.</p>

    <p>In the corner, where the darkness seemed almost absolute, her
      hand touched metal, a spike driven deep into the structure, and by
      searching with her toe, up and down the angle, she found another,
      part of a ladder of pitons.</p>

    <p>She climbed quickly, aware of her vulnerability as she emerged
      again into the open. The fickle wind was blowing again, softly cool
      against her skin, and above its low whispering, Nancy thought she
      could hear another sound, faint and itself wind-like, but in one
      instant more, it was past. She did not strain to hear it again, but
      climbed until she was level with the ledge that, following the
      building, ran under Brady's office windows. The window was
      fractionally ajar, opening towards her, and stepping from the
      pitons, she began to edge towards it. She turned about in the
      corner, where the angle of the ledge made a better place to stand,
      and on her heels, shuffled to the window that was her gateway to
      sanctuary.</p>

    <p>Beneath the window, as she stepped backwards through it, a chair
      had been placed ready to serve as a step for anyone choosing to
      enter by that route. She pulled the window to, latching it shut &#8212;
      there was no purpose served in letting anyone guess where she had
      gone, and crossed to the desk. She would leave a message, now that
      she felt safe enough, and this time, it was in clear, brief and to
      the point. Sorry, it read I went East. N. If they didn't understand
      that, the help that might have been wouldn't have been worth it
      anyway.</p>

    <p>Under the desk, in a small recess in the knee-hole, she found a
      key-ring, with one key, that to the office opposite. That office
      opened onto the outside world, and the way she would have to take.
      She went back and forth, opening the door, then replacing the key,
      but each time, the corridor remained thankfully deserted.</p>

    <p>At long last, however, she stood looking out at the grassland,
      and three hundred some yards away, the forest. One minute to climb,
      another to run, and she would be almost impossible to locate. There
      was no movement out there, and even the shadows seemed devoid of
      menace. With the time of danger so short, it was unlikely that she
      would be intercepted, and so, before her mind could start
      generating its own Rorschached threats, she began the descent.</p>

    <p>She paused in her movement for the briefest moment as she
      reached the last piton, and hung, some eight feet up from the
      ground. Faint and far away it was, scarce heard above the quiet
      wind, her strained breathing, was another, unidentifiable noise.
      She steadfastly ignored it, to prevent her fears latching on to it,
      and let go her hold.</p>

    <p>She dropped, and as she hit the tarmac, she turned and was in
      that instant running as if all the fiends of Hell were at her
      heels. Stride, legs scissoring, cover ground, that was what she
      must do, what she forced her body to. The earth was soft beneath
      her feet, and her track was left visible in the grass that slowly
      recovered from the crushing.</p>

    <p>The wind roared in her ears as she ran, and under the light of
      the rings, it seemed so natural to her that she should select the
      proper cues of tone and waveform, with talent normally beyond her,
      to make the life-song again, and in the song came the fire. Easily,
      she ascended to and achieved that different awareness, as she had
      so fleetingly known before. She was with all the world of nature,
      but uniquely an individual, marked as such by the gem she wore,
      almost as a medallion. She noticed without surprise, that this time
      she did not need to sing herself &#8212; the artifact had taught, and she
      was learning.</p>

    <p>But what had she learned? What more could and would it enable
      her to do? She could not tell, but the fancies that sprung to her
      mind frightened her with visions of godhead. The Q'l-hrui had been
      termed Ancient Gods simply for their apparent powers, but now she
      feared that the reality was more a literal interpretation. Nancy,
      goddess of&#8230; Nature, perhaps? The concept fascinated her in a
      terrible way. The only sort of god-hood she had sought was that of
      great age, as her ancestors had achieved.</p>

    <p>What was the stone and setting she wore, that they had belonged
      to a pre-flight race, who also possessed blivits, even if not of
      local origin? Temple site, Chan had said &#8212; an apt enough place, if
      her ideas were correct.</p>

    <p>Nancy felt in her heart that even she would perform obeisance to
      someone wielding that which she had won the custodianship of. She
      was not going to be able to fit in her old niches, might not even
      fit this culture, unless perhaps she were to remake the
      Partnership, or dissolve it.</p>

    <p>If she could&#8230; it gave her something that she had always
      craved, completeness in herself, without needing any other, and
      that could be painfully addictive, as perfections always is.</p>

    <p>Roar &#8212; yes, the wind roared about her, and conjured up the song,
      but there was another sound to jolt her from the in-turned rapture.
      Still under enhancement, she noticed a droning, soft, but apart
      from the windsong that woke her.</p>

    <p>Nancy turned to look for its source, casting quick glances over
      her shoulder as she ran. To her horror, she saw that what was
      responsible was an aircar, drifting towards her on muffled jets. An
      aircar, moreover, that bore the globe and chain insignia of the
      matts. It was this, she guessed, that she had heard so faintly
      before, as it patrolled the perimeter in case she should get that
      far.</p>

    <p>She ran even more frantically than before, the adrenaline again
      surging through her bloodstream. Cover she sought, but all that
      there was nearby was a single bench, with a litter-bin beside it.
      It would have to do, and she dived behind it for cover.</p>

    <p>Her blaster was in her hand as soon as she stopped, and her
      first hurried shot cut a glowing hole into one side, unfortunately
      missing any of the vital systems, and before the could fire again,
      the gun was hot in her hand. She flung it away, and her belt too,
      where she carried two extra clips, dropping behind the bench as
      soon as she had discarded them.</p>

    <p>They exploded noisily under the influence of the dissipation
      field, in a firework display of light. One of the vortices of
      energy released drifted through the bench beside her, cutting a
      clean edged hole as it went its own way. The bolts avoided the
      aircar which only rocked gently as the blast hit it.</p>

    <p>Totally disarmed, for her stunner had been still holstered, she
      had no other strategy open to her other than to run. At least, she
      reckoned, it would give the matts a run for their money, requiring
      them to at least make an effort to capture her. And who knew &#8212; she
      might even escape yet. Fifty yards she covered, and now only a
      hundred remained when a stunner beam hit the ground off to her
      right. She cringed, looked away, and kept running. The purple
      crawled towards her, jerkily, as the gunman tried to compensate for
      the relative motions of the aircar and the target.</p>

    <p>Nancy felt a burning soreness across her back as at last the
      beam struck her, and slight disorientation, but she continued to
      run. The amulet she wore &#8212; what was it that it functioned so &#8212; grew
      almost painfully hot, as if it were absorbing the blast in the aura
      of azure around her.</p>

    <p>As the seconds passed, however, she revised that opinion. Make
      that <em>most</em> of the blast, she muttered aloud as she ran.
      Soon, she was feeling as if drunk, and her vision went all distant.
      Thankfully the effects were not as gross as they had been before&#8230;
      she could still run, unnauseated, until something cold and wet
      enfolded her.</p>

    <p>It grasped her in an unyielding rubbery grip, binding her arms
      and legs. She tripped, stumbled. The ground rose up to meet her.
      Distantly she felt the impact, the pain in nose and mouth as they
      hit the ground, mere feet from the first trees. She could feel the
      earth and the grass, and taste blood in her mouth. Her breath
      bubbled in her nostrils, and her face was wet.</p>

    <p>&#8220;My first proper nosebleed,&#8221; she thought to herself as the night
      closed in on her mind.</p>
