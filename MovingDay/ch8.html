    <h1>Dreams</h1>
  </div>
  <div id="upperblaze" class="silver">&nbsp;</div>
  <div id="content">
    <p>Nancy dreamed. Her mind wandered in strange paths through the
      musty, unused places of her mind. The pictures and the places and
      the ideas were all strange, with a strangeness bordering on the
      uncomfortable. Yet they were only dreams, a part of her second
      life, where excitement and daring were to be had without any price
      to pay. She was happy with her dreams, and could trust them, as
      being herself mistress over them.</p>

    <p>She did not realized that this was not so, that the dramas
      playing out before her were born from patternings in crystal, set
      by the will of others, not fantasies of her own.</p>

    <hr />
    <p>Nancy stood in the Granite Garden, a maze of fantastic statuary
      in the south of Castle Wolf. It probably had a formal name, this
      place, but she was content with the play name she had given it a
      decade and more before. This was her special place, from as soon as
      she discovered it : a place designed for games of' hiding and
      chasing, and just eerie enough to add spice. The place had also
      acquired other memories for her. Here it had been, on a sun-bed at
      the top of a small tower, a rook in a chaos of chess pieces, that
      she had first made love with Tricia; the first time for either of
      them.</p>

    <p>Yet something had soured the friendly warmth of the place. The
      sky had clouded over with winter storm clouds, in the darkest of
      sky-greys, and the wind was fitful and cold, driving grit lashing
      across her bare skin. Those statues that had recognizable faces
      leered malevolently at her, making her more consciously aware of
      her nakedness than the temperature.</p>

    <p>Somewhere close by, someone laughed, powerfully, satanically, in
      unholy glee. A girl screamed shrilly, from a torment appropriate to
      that hideous cackle.</p>

    <p>Nancy headed towards the source of the sound, fighting her way
      between statues that seemed to move to block her progress through
      the mazes. The screams came again, bubbling as they faded. They
      were not always screams now &#8212; they had lost power, were instead
      groans of unendurable anguish.</p>

    <p>At last, she stumbled into an open space, and stopped, horrified
      at what she saw. The frame of a child's swing had been set up
      across from where she stood, and instead of a seat, something else
      had been chained to the crossbar. It was Tricia, hanging by her
      wrists, shackled to the bolt holes, her body had been savagely
      mutilated, but through it all, she was still alive and conscious.
      Their eyes met, in a plea for help, or surcease. The carnage
      sickened Nancy to her stomach, and to think that that body had been
      once so beautiful&#8230;</p>

    <p>Standing between them, turning now to see where Tricia stared,
      holding in her hand, the gory scalpel that caused the damage, was
      the Lady Jeanne Marygay of Wolf.</p>

    <p>Despite her acceptance of Jeanne's higher social rank, Nancy did
      not show any respect as the red anger and black hate rose in her
      mind.</p>

    <p>&#8220;You bitch!&#8221; Nancy could say nothing further. There were no words
      she knew that could suitably express her complete outrage. She
      sought to conjure up hellfires to cast at that laughing
      monstrosity, but the dream fabric refused to obey her.</p>

    <p>Words failed her again as the Lady Jeanne effortlessly took her
      and hung her in Tricia's place, and began slowly to remove her skin
      with a scalpel now blunted from previous use. The agony burned
      incessantly, but she hated equally.</p>

    <p>Both sensations seemed to go on forever.</p>

    <hr />
    <p>Linna, High Priestess, stirred in her sleep, and woke. Sleep was
      elusive that night, in the heat. Besides, tomorrow the Great Song
      would be sung, a full month before the date normally appointed to
      it.</p>

    <p>So the priests of the Skyfather urged, and despite her rank,
      Linna was content to bow to the superior wisdom of their
      astrological lore. They had pointed out all the new stars that had
      blossomed in the night sky, an event that had never been recorded
      since first the heavens had been established three thousand years
      before, and the great plays of the southern lights, brighter and
      more persistent that ever in living memory. Those were facts,
      incontrovertible, and there for everyone to see &#8212; even the
      common-folk.</p>

    <p>She threw aside the bedclothes and went to the window to look at
      them. They were bright indeed in the crystal clear air, which
      flamed in the south. It was no wonder that the populace had been
      thrown into near panic. There was talk of the gods coming down to
      earth, and the end of the world; something especially favoured by
      the heretical preachers that had sprung up like a cancer in the
      year since these things had started</p>

    <p>On a separate plane, Nancy interpreted the data. There was a war
      on up there, moving this way at just under light speed &#8212; no other
      way that the light could stack up so neatly. That gave this world
      of Lincoln very little time to live, before the raging fire of its
      sun burned it clean.</p>

    <p>None of this bothered Linna. She was too involved with the
      intricate patterning of the dance, and the flow of the song.
      Unnoticed by her bed burned the deep blue gem, the regalia of the
      Earth other, woken by the patterns of mind.</p>

    <hr />
    <p>Nancy was young again, only five or six years old, and her
      physical viewpoint on the world was disconcertingly different. She
      was playing catch with her sister Tracy. She was tall and slim, and
      Nancy found herself slightly envious of her looks.</p>

    <p>She missed her catch, the ball sailing past her to land in the
      bushes that edged the open space of grass where they played. It was
      dark and green under their huddled leaves, but the ball was made of
      brightly coloured plastic, in yellows and reds, and was easy to see
      in the gloom.</p>

    <p>She crawled forwards to pick it up, but something moved it away
      from her clumsy reach. She struggled after it, following its
      retreat into the depths of the shrubbery and then suddenly she was
      out in the open again, in a lagoon of open that she had never
      guessed to exist. She was not alone.</p>

    <p>The Lady Jeanne held the ball, and gathered around the clearing
      were all her sisters, daughters and nieces, each one bearing the
      aspect of their age.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I hate little girls,&#8221; said Jeanne, as if as spokes'an, &#8220;We all
      hate little girls, don't we?&#8221;</p>

    <p>The rest of them nodded and murmured their assent.</p>

    <p>&#8220;You were playing catch, weren't you?&#8221; the sneering voice
      continued, leaving Nancy chilled with fear, &#8220;and now we're going to
      play catch.&#8221;</p>

    <p>This was too much for Nancy. She broke and ran as fast as her
      infant body might allow, but Jeanne was the faster, and grabbed her
      up &#8212; holding her despite her fiercest struggles. When she quieted a
      little, Jeanne hurled her at another of the girls.</p>

    <p>Sky and earth, sun and clouds spun past her, and then she was
      caught in cruel hands, and thrown on to another. Sometimes they
      didn't catch her, and she fell on the hard earth.</p>

    <p>It ended, finally.</p>

    <hr />
    <p>Nancy wandered alone in a space of unreality. All around her was
      black, save glowing outlines in neon colours that drifted like
      deep-sea fish. She could move in that isolation as she wished;
      there was only the problem that one place was much like another in
      this sea. There was only the faintest of gradients to distinguish
      one place from another.</p>

    <p>She reached for the source of the signposting, across an
      indistinct distance of space and time. And as she moved, she called
      the name of the only person she cared deeply about: &#8220;Tricia, help
      me, help me, my love.&#8221;</p>

    <p>And pictures came to her from that source, fragmented at first,
      but unmistakably real. She looked out at the world through Tricia's
      eyes, and there was a crystal sharpness about the contact that cut
      through the fog of illusion that had clouded her dreams.</p>

    <p>Her soul partner had departed the control room, and had returned
      to her room, where now she ate, wearily. She hoped that everything
      was under control, knowing that although the first operation had
      been interrupted from outside, that the present search would not
      fail &#8212; although whether it would be in time would be another
      matter. In the central control of operations, working against the
      pressures of time and violence, the Clan was bending its will to
      Nancy's rescue.</p>

    <p>For herself, Tricia hoped fervently that they would succeed
      before it was too late for Nancy and worried that they would not
      until she could not eat. From her viewpoint, Nancy tried to reach
      Tricia, to tell her what was happening and as she strained, their
      waking minds touched, just for an instant. Love and reassurance
      blossomed where there had only been loneliness and fear.</p>

    <p>They exchanged only a brief statement of their names, but that
      was enough of a message for either.</p>

    <hr />
    <p>It was a day of High Dinner in the castle, this one to mark the
      birthday of Trixy Linda. The whole Clan had gathered together in
      the Great Hall, each in the formal robes of their station, most
      vying with their contemporaries for outrageousness of design and
      completeness of ostentation.</p>

    <p>Nancy herself had chosen modest attire &#8212; her gown in purple,
      trimmed with silver, and on her brow, the circlet marking her as
      holding the rank of barronne, but that was as nothing against the
      metal and jewel encrusted outfits that adorned the high table.</p>

    <div class="floatright" id="arms"><img alt="[Decoration] Clan Wolf Arms (as blazoned)" title="Clan Wolf Arms"
        height="413" src="wolfarms.png" width="363" /></div>

    <p>Above that great gathering, on the wall, beneath a
      representation of the arms of the clan &#8212; argent, a bend sinister
      sable, between two wolves heads erased sable, armed and langued
      gules, was inscribed the roster of worlds that the Clan had graced.
      Lindisfarne, Starbow, Luthien, Heartward, Toehold, Last Gasp and
      Wyvern &#8212; even the five year-olds knew that list to recite.</p>

    <p>Nancy herself was seated on the middle file of tables, midway
      down, on the left as one faced the high table, surrounded by her
      contemporaries, engaging in a frivolous conversation of some
      lightweight matter, whiling away the time until the food began to
      arrive.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Nancy Elanor!&#8221; The Lady Jeanne roared out that name. Nancy felt
      her heart pound, and cold sickness close in on her belly. She
      turned to look at the source of the call.</p>

    <p>All conversation ceased in the instant.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Stand on the table, Nancy Elanor,&#8221; came the command.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Do it, damn you!&#8221;</p>

    <p>Nancy had hesitated but for an instant.</p>

    <p>Aware of all the watching eye, she obeyed, kicking the cutlery
      carelessly aside. A knife clattered to the floor, loud in the
      ominous silence.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Now strip!&#8221;</p>

    <p>The circlet fell dully to the wood of the table, followed by the
      gown, carelessly discarded. Her hands shook as she unzipped her
      boots and kicked them off, wreaking further havoc down the table,
      Her grasp was no better as she fumbled with the fastenings to her
      dress, but the elegantly tailored blue cloth tumbled at last to her
      feet, and she stepped from its ring.</p>

    <p>There was a pause, and then her underwear joined the pile of
      discarded clothing.</p>

    <p>Nancy felt the eyes of the gathering upon her, lustful,
      laughing, cruel. She dreaded to think what might be in store for
      her at their hands. Only Tricia was not caught up in that fever.
      There was sadness in her eyes, and fear as she stared with morbid
      fascination, wanting to tear her eyes away from the sight.</p>

    <p>There was a slight disturbance at the high table, and then
      Jeanne began to walk slowly towards her. Even at this time, she
      could notice the full regal attire and bearing of the woman she
      loathed, and the heavy whip she carried in her hand.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Stand away from her,&#8221; she cried as she approached</p>

    <p>They did, nervously moving away to form a circle about both
      Nancy and Jeanne. Coldly, the mother of the clan cast aside her
      heavy robes of silver fur, streaked with black, and her crown of
      argent and adamant, and held the lash ready. Their eyes met, and
      Nancy saw sickening savagery in their depths, and could only reply
      with fear and hate.</p>

    <p>Jeanne raised the whip, showing the barbs woven into its length,
      and then brought it crashing down on Nancy's back. The end curled
      around her and raised a weal across her bare stomach.</p>

    <hr />
    <p>The sky was clear, and a faded blue. From its vantage point, the
      sun shone down in scorching summer heat upon the great theatre.
      There were a few pinpoints of light in the sky that were stars in
      their death agonies, the aurora were a faint shimmer in the
      southern sky, like curtains of light.</p>

    <p>The theatre was decked with flowers, and thronged with the
      devout, pilgrims come to this central rite, to be caught up in the
      oneness of life, in celebration and worship.</p>

    <p>In the arena, the priests and priestesses assembled, ready for
      the commencement, on the hour deemed most auspicious. There was a
      heavy scent in the air of raw fragrances of flowers and herbs in
      the oils upon their skins. Set around the stage, incense burners
      sent up narrow columns of white smoke.</p>

    <p>The finger of shadow on the sundials reached the appointed mark.
      Linna spoke the first words of the chant, and that was enough. On
      the instant, the dance began, each dancer following the path that
      they had been trained to, unified by the power that was in the
      amulet Linna wore. She was as if at a distance as she moved through
      that joyous crowd, the Great Words of the song pouring from her
      lips, and her body moving to the rhythms of the dance, embodying
      the ebb and flow of the seasons, and the intoxicating pulse of
      life.</p>

    <p>Sweat streaked her body, drying quickly in the scorching heat,
      but still clogging up with the dust. Her feet were sore, bruised on
      the rough stone, but the joy within buoyed her up, and her steps
      did not falter. Time passed without anyone being conscious of it,
      until the clearly remembered closing stanza began. Already the
      dancers were pairing off to honour the Earth Mother.</p>

    <p>And in the end, she was alone on the open stage, save for the
      one priest who would possess her on the altar. The last words were
      spoken, the last steps made, and she stood there panting from the
      exertion.</p>

    <p>They faced each other, and Linna let slip her tattered garlands,
      her dusty gown. She turned to run to the altar. Locked within her
      Nancy's personality writhed for escape.</p>

    <p>The Sun! She did not know who had first made that cry, but it
      was taken up by all the multitude, in the sky, the aurora flared,
      even against a sun swollen and grown brighter, its touch was
      parching, and searing, its light bluish and hotter than any
      furnace.</p>

    <p>This was the nova, the death of world by the hands of uncaring
      gods, but though the people might fear, none knew truly what was
      happening, none save Nancy, and she could not act, she could only
      wait as the heat claimed them all.</p>

    <hr />
    <p>There was darkness, it was cool and bathed her like stream water
      from the mountains, fresh melted from the snows of a hundred
      winters ago. There was a pathway in the dark, leading to a doorway,
      and she took it, and she and Tricia were together again.</p>

    <p>Both slept, and both dreamed, and together they could master the
      flow of their dreaming. All their dreams were strange and
      beautiful</p>

    <hr />
    <p>In Clarke orbit, the Clan Wolf troops were considering their
      possible avenues of escape. Two were open to them &#8212; either to
      hijack the shuttle taking the mercenaries down to the planet, or to
      wait a further two hours and try an escape immediately after a
      Link, when the Linkers would be unable to act.</p>

    <p>Every second of their discussion they were painfully aware of
      their vulnerability to detection by any of the psychically aware
      Guild personnel, should any be so minded as to eavesdrop. There was
      only the standard convention on such invasions of personal privacy
      to protect them now, and even that couldn't prevent an accidental
      overhearing.</p>

    <p>The former alternative was tackled first, with its great
      advantage of providing immediate transport and the drawbacks of
      having to face active Linkers and the assumed mercenaries.
      Conversely, the latter plan would avoid such lack of finesse, but
      possibly leave them without any transport available.</p>

    <p>Eventually, they decided to wait for the link, and chance the
      transport, having determined that it gave the better chance of
      success, although neither seemed to be particularly hopeful. But
      they were content with that slim chance. Two and one half hour
      hence, during the psychic maelstrom of the link would be the most
      appropriate time for departure.</p>

    <hr />
    <p>Time passed. Dreamers moved through the fantasies of the night,
      and schemers awaited the next Link. And on each of these, the fate
      of thousands rested.</p>

    <p>Come the appointed moment, in the Snowflake, the Linkers reached
      out with their minds to forge new existence, to touch their sisters
      at Windfall Station, the next stop heartward.</p>

    <p>The span of the great ring blinked like an eye, and at its
      centre, red fire blossomed, and green and gold rushed to join it,
      to rush outwards to the circumference bounding them, where they
      bubbled and frothed harmlessly around the gate to another
      place.</p>

    <p>And as the whirlpool of colour spun and frothed in the ring, two
      dozen silver haired, grey skinned shapes made their move. Following
      courses reconstructed from memories and the briefest of scouting
      expeditions, they made their separate ways to the main docking
      complex.</p>

    <p>Scattered, they avoided suspicion just long enough for them to
      reach their goal. Then, again <cite>en masse</cite>, they moved in
      on the few people hanging around, binding and gaging them briskly,
      and leaving them to be found later. Fireteams detached themselves,
      going to seek out transport for the escape, and one came up with a
      suitable vessel. It was a small in-system craft, presumably parked
      by someone gone away, with all the creature comforts that their
      previous trip had lacked.</p>

    <p>They packed themselves into the craft, and as soon as the hatch
      was sealed, Jakita, in the pilot's seat, gunned the engines into
      action. Docking latches screamed and failed as the small ship tried
      to tow the whole station along, against the locking action of the
      Link, and then the ship was free to plummet towards the planet at
      its highest acceleration, taking them beyond the effective aegis of
      the Linkers in a scant handful of seconds.</p>

    <p>Strained by their recent exertions, the Linkers attempted no
      fight with a ship that was being steered at ever increasing speed
      towards the largest concentration of inhabitation on the world
      below.</p>

    <p>And in that place, Nancy dreamed.</p>

    <hr />
    <p>Minutes passed, and the fleeing ship altered its course
      eastwards, risking everything on a descent at highest feasible
      velocity into the safety of the Castle. Towards their home, they
      cut a thousand-mile long path of ionization through the upper
      atmosphere, a trail that endured for minutes after that meteoric
      descent.</p>

    <p>Only at the last possible moment did they radio ahead a call
      that the protective screens be dropped for the instants of' their
      passage, to give the least possible warning to the besieging
      forces. The nanosecond reflexes of the defence computers opened the
      outer barrier when the car was but yards away, and closed with such
      tolerance afterwards, but in the ten milliseconds during which the
      outer screen was down, the five assaulting cybersoldiers poured all
      the fire they could into perimeter installations, and the heavy
      laser batteries that were uncloaked burst into life. Five transient
      fingers of light ignited five longer lasting, but still brief
      flashes in the air.</p>

    <p>The war had claimed its first irrevocable victims, and no one
      could say that they would be the only ones. There could be little
      hope of any sortie from the castle in the days to come; anything
      that asKorran, or the telepath might have to say to shed light on
      Nancy's plight would remain unknown.</p>

    <hr />
    <p>The world turned on its axis, and morning: eventually came to
      the city of High Prospect, the ascending sun lighting its towers
      first in pink, then orange and then dazzling white.</p>

    <p>On the couch where she lay, Nancy stirred, waking slowly from
      her sleep. Bacon was frying in the kitchen, its scent making her
      mouth water, its sizzling loud enough to be annoying, should she
      attempt to sleep again. She was thirsty, and her head ached, and
      when she tried to remember what she had dreamed, she felt decidedly
      uncomfortable. Whatever they had been, it seemed wisest to forget
      them now.</p>

    <p>Nancy sat up, and swept her hair into some sort of order, and
      looked around her, remembering the events of that last night, a
      night that seemed to have endured forever, in chaotic, feverish
      activity. By contrast it was nice here, and quiet, nicer by far
      than at home where&#8230; She shuddered without really knowing what
      there was to shudder about. Trying to think about it felt like
      struggling in cotton wool and besides, hunger was at that instant
      more pressing than that sort of worry.</p>

    <p>She joined her hosts in the kitchen, where Janice was cooking
      the meal, and Guy was setting out the plates.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Morning, Janice. Morning, Guy.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Good morning, Nancy, how are you today? How much do you think
      you can eat?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;OK. I feel a bit crook, but should be all right when I wake up
      properly, I feel hungry enough to finish off whatever you put in
      front of me.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Whatever you say. We can take it easy today, at least until this
      evening. It must have been terrible being chased by those
      barbarians.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;The chase was no fun, but I think you're going a little far
      calling them barbarians &#8212; they have their own ideals &#8212; and I'm not
      so sure I like some of our history so terribly much. They might
      have a point however badly they put it.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I suppose you're right, Nancy. The idealists are probably a
      decent bunch. Its the corporation money-grubbers that are to be
      despised, like Shammarra and Kingarra. They're staying in that
      tower over there&#8230;&#8221; Janice pointed out of the window at another
      building.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Just think what you could do with a small cybersoldier hand
      weapon &#8212; no hassle, just point it and no more directors for a
      couple of large corporations. They'd be too busy then keeping
      themselves from civil war and takeover. That'd see you safe, these
      last few days.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;If I had a gun. Let's eat.&#8221;</p>

    <hr />
    <p>That morning they spent strolling through the parks that made up
      by far the greatest proportion of area of the works of intelligence
      on that world. Despite the heavy make-up she wore, and the long
      black wig, designed to protect her from casual notice, Nancy felt
      freer than she could ever remember having been. All weight of
      responsibility had been lifted from her, all the compulsions to act
      as a good clan member against the dictates of her own self
      interest, all the hiding from alerted opponents of her presence.
      Though the storm might rage about her, she was at the eye of the
      hurricane.</p>

    <p>On the hill slopes above the city to the north, they sat and ate
      a picnic lunch. The city itself was the centrepiece of their view,
      a rush of gleaming white, spawning tall towers that rose into the
      pale sky. Small specks of colour drifted around the structures,
      soaring in the thermals from their great concrete aprons, people
      hang-gliding around the only city this world possessed.</p>

    <p>Nancy sat, and watched them soar about, as they launched
      themselves down the slope, against the breeze, and moved up and
      away in widening circuits. They were no source of threat; only to
      be envied for their freedom of action, and after months of paranoia
      the chance to throw off her habitual patterns of distrust was
      intoxicating. The close, almost family-like nature of the group
      enhanced the feeling of sudden freedom. She had regretted her most
      recent return to the castle, but she was now almost dreading the
      next one.</p>

    <p>The thought wiped the smile from her face, saddening her deeply.
      The Castle seemed so restrictive after all this that even the
      prospect of return cramped her. For a long while she sat staring
      wistfully down at the bright city, not seeing, and only half
      hearing what was being said.</p>

    <p>Yet looking back on it later, she could say that she enjoyed
      that afternoon, whatever else she might qualify that statement
      with, and it was with regret that she agreed with the decision to
      go back home. But that was not until the shadows were lengthening,
      and swinging far around to the south-east, and when their stomachs
      began to suggest that dinner would be a good thing to have. Even
      from the apartment now, the shadows stretched beyond sight, and the
      air was cooling, although the direct sunlight was still warm. The
      fateful evening would soon be upon them.</p>

    <p>The local time was already shortly after 17:30. In less than an
      hour the sun would set on the city. While Guy prepared the meal,
      Janice and Nancy prepared for the flight to the Castle. All the
      while, Nancy hesitated, seeking to make a sufficient delay that
      they would have to postpone the operation until the next day. But
      that was not to be. Guy and Janice had obviously done the
      preparations in advance, leaving only the details for Nancy to fill
      in. The meal was soon ready, and Nancy ate slowly, the food seeming
      to lose its taste. The prospect of going home did not appeal to her
      and yet there was Tricia, waiting, for her, afraid that she might
      be lost to her forever. With that end in mind, she was determined
      to go through with it, even if she would leave as soon as the
      castle lifted.</p>

    <p>And when the eating was done, Guy suggested to Nancy that she
      have a nap now, against what could be a very long night. She
      agreed, partly from expediency, partly from a weariness that was
      consuming her. She was thoroughly exhausted, all too ready to go to
      sleep.</p>

    <p>And when she did succumb to its lure, Guy placed the helmet upon
      her head, and loaded it with a second cassette. She mumbled
      something indistinct as the first message began to pour through her
      brain, and then was silent.</p>

    <p>Guy and Janice looked at the clock, and at the sleeping
      girl.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Everything on schedule. Now for the next stage.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Guy took up the phone, and dialled a number.</p>

    <hr />
    <p>That morning, unwontedly late for her, but before in absolute
      terms, taking time zones into account, Nancy woke, Tricia made the
      decision to break out of her half-sleep and get up.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Good morning, Tricia. The usual breakfast?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Sure. Anything happen while I've been asleep?&#8221;</p>

    <p>There were a series of explosions, and the distant sounds of
      gunfire. When the sounds of combat lulled again, Genevieve replied
      to her.</p>

    <p>&#8220;We've had no luck on tracing Nancy so far. However, the girls
      who were sent out after her managed to escape from the Snowflake.
      We even managed to get five of the matt cybersoldiers while the
      screens were down to let the girls' ship in. We only lost a few
      areas of the outer wall during the attack. Nothing much has
      happened since. The assaulting forces have built up massively &#8212;
      it's going to be almost impossible to get in or out of the Castle
      from mow on. It's mostly air cover, very little ground
      activity.</p>

    <p>&#8220;They seem to be biding their time for some reason, waiting, and
      no one is sure why. I don't like it, and neither does Jeanne. I
      believe that they're waiting until they can get something that can
      take us out in one go &#8212; they must know as well as we do that it's
      only going to be another hundred hours until we lift.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Other stuffs &#8212; the platoon who went out after Nancy want to take
      a heavy set of weaponry and set off after asKorran and the Guild
      telepath Nancy mentioned, to try and get some more information, but
      I don't think it'll fly. Jeanne is a little more calculating than
      that.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Thanks, Genevieve.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Tricia thought of the dreams she had had, and of Nancy who had
      been with her during that time. it grieved her to consider that it
      would only be in dreams that she would ever again meet her, as a
      skein of animated memories.</p>

    <p>She ate her breakfast without appetite. Without Nancy there
      seemed little point in life. There were other people, but she
      didn't get along with anyone quite the way she did with Nancy.</p>

    <p>And yet&#8230;</p>

    <p>She checked the situation at each of the other Castles. The
      inactivity of the matts around Castle Wolf began to worry her more.
      DawnCastle, holding of the two Hrulgani families, was only under
      the lightest of sieges, a token effort, in the face of the
      knowledge that that Castle would lift within twelve hours, the
      first of them all.</p>

    <p>Castle Abiding, Fort Brady and Shallamir Hold were each under
      intensive assault, and yet only Fort Brady would be leaving after
      Castle Wolf. And despite that, a large force just waited, inactive,
      around Castle Wolf. Could they be waiting on a secret weapon that
      would give them the whole Castle at a stroke? Could that weapon be
      Nancy?</p>

    <p>Tricia was certain to both answers, certain that they would each
      be &#8216;yes&#8217;, and she told Genevieve so, only to find that the analysis
      had already been made, and that plans to deal with that event were
      being drawn up. That left Tricia with a crazy hope for her
      girlfriend's life, a hope that sustained her against the silent
      hours of the day.</p>

    <p>During that day, the last but two lifter unit was completed,
      excuse for some minor celebration. Jakita's mission never flew,
      despite her protestations. The night came down again, and midnight
      approached, and still, the fighting remained low-key. And in High
      Prospect, Nancy was drugged again, and fed dreams.</p>

    <hr />
    <p>The sun was hot, and the air was choked with dust. Casual eddies
      moved across the ground, marked by whatever litter there was for
      them to pick up. Nancy stood at the defence perimeter of the castle
      her home, gun in hand, an army at her back, ready to throw down the
      evil queen and scatter her folk. She waited the word that would
      signal that the all-out intensive assault had begun around the
      whole perimeter, spearheaded by fresh troops, and while she waited,
      she sweated inside the light harness she wore, as a toned-down
      cybersoldier unit. She would be glad when they gained the
      buildings, just for the cool and the shade.</p>

    <p>After what seemed an age, the word came.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Now!&#8221; Nancy yelled, and leapt out into the open, followed by a
      small group of soldiers. The sun-baked earth felt hollow under
      their feet as they bounded forwards, assisted by the power of the
      suits, ten meters at a stride. Automatic gun-turrets tracked
      uncertainly recognizing her as a member of the clan, and holding
      their fire. She had to get behind them and out of their fields of
      fire before someone noticed what was happening, and overrode that
      fragile protection.</p>

    <p>They lost two stragglers that way, or simply because they were
      so far away from Nancy that they were beyond her protection, before
      piling to a halt inside the first perimeter. Their protection
      fields sparkled under the beaming, flared, and died, leaving two
      charred corpses sprawled on the dead ground. Those losses were
      acceptable and had been planned for.</p>

    <p>As they regrouped for the next challenge, Nancy sent up a flare,
      searing whiter than the sun. At that signal, five heavy combat
      lasers went into action, streaming their power at the five most
      vital sectors of the castle. That would keep the lifter fields up,
      and in so doing, keep them safe from internal laser batteries until
      they were across the minefield and under their maximum
      depression.</p>

    <p>Directly under one of those titanic beams, as it roared through
      the air, Nancy led her team across the dry earth, under a hail of
      small arms fire from hastily assembled militia teams. She fired
      back, sending the defenders scattering.</p>

    <p>With the lifter fields in-between, there was no such thing as
      aiming. Those fields were now tighter than they had been on Nancy's
      departure, raising the dust twenty feet or more into the air in an
      almost opaque wall. As the attacking team passed through them, the
      fields snatched at them, throwing them several feet up into the
      air.</p>

    <p>That was the time they were most defenceless. For an instant,
      they were disoriented, under the open sky and within the fields.
      One enemy fireteam could wreak havoc if it caught them &#8212; but none
      did, the reactions were just too slow, and the only walls to hold
      them out were of stone and of metal. Blaster in hand, she poured
      through at the head of the avenging horde, cutting down the Clan
      troops as they tried to stem the tide.</p>

    <p>A wooden door puffed into smoke at the touch of her handgun,
      leaving only the frames that had bound it together, and she hurried
      into the corridor beyond. She was alone within her home, save for
      the lone figure waiting for her at the end of the way. With hate in
      her heart, she advanced, gun at the ready, intending to leave the
      death shot until the last moment.</p>

    <p>But as her finger tightened on the trigger, she recognized who
      it was that she faced, and in her horror at what she had been about
      to do, dropped the gun.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Tricia,&#8221; Nancy moaned in anguish, &#8220;what have I done? Lift! Lift!
      Lift the castle now. Save what you can. It's not too late yet.&#8221;</p>

    <p>All her will went into that. The castle had to lift, and before
      that, all the pre-patterning of the dream shuddered and failed. The
      earth rumbled beneath the castle, and trembled noticeably
      underfoot, and then the whole structure, all hundred billion tons
      of it, drifted majestically from its resting place, up into the
      starry void. Behind her, although she did not see, the figures of
      the matts became misty, and drifted away like smoke. She was just
      not interested in such things. Her eyes streamed with tears, and
      she rested her head on Tricia's shoulder, and held her tight.</p>

    <p>Reality tore under the desperation of her grasp and she held
      more than a dreamthing in her arms. In her state of almost
      unquestioning stupor, it did not seem surprising to her that she
      should hold with her mind the mind of the real girl.</p>

    <p>Tricia had been lying in her bed, alone this night, waiting for
      sleep to come and pass the hours away, thinking wistfully of the
      dreams she had dreamed the previous night, with Nancy by her side,
      in cities of gold and coral and open plains of green grass, or by a
      roaring fire in the middle of winter. And in the middle of that
      state of daydream came the contact, strongly, not like the fleeting
      ghost of one that had come while she had slept the night before, a
      contact that she thought had been no more than a mere dream.</p>

    <p>This one she could not so deny. It was Nancy that she held, not
      a figment of her imagination, and she did not care to look a gift
      horse in the mouth.</p>

    <p>They communicated without words, not needing any such clumsy
      medium by which to carry their messages, which were too deep for
      their limitations. But however the messages were encoded, the
      information did pass along the line, and each knew what the other
      was doing and where.</p>

    <p>Nancy, deep in the darkness of her mind, with falsehoods and
      stupidity being pumped mechanically into a body obviously
      incapacitated by drugs, clung tightly to that misty connection,
      drawing reality about herself as a cloak, taking sustenance from
      Tricia's mind.</p>

    <p>And with the strength she gained, she listened beyond the
      torrent of drivel entering her mind, trying to reach her captors.
      But not knowing how, she failed to do more than locate them,
      without knowing the keys by which she might contact them in turn,
      and force them to release her.</p>

    <p>She waited, holding minds with Tricia, afraid that if she were
      to relax the link, it would break without her being able to restore
      it. It was an hour and a half that she remained like that, her only
      contact with reality through her link with Tricia, and that her
      only defence against the indoctrination aimed against her. Then, at
      the fringes of her awareness, another mind moved, one open to her
      probings, enough that she could listen to its conscious thoughts,
      and see through its eyes, and feel with its other senses. It was a
      girl's mind, and she was walking towards the apartment door,
      impatient with something or someone.</p>

    <p>She knocked, and waited a few seconds for Guy to come and open
      the door, and beckon her in, and welcoming her by the name of
      Valerie.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Why, hello, Guy, she answered him, what did you want me for?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;You remember I told you we had captured one of the Clan Wolf
      girls, and put her under indoctrination? Well we're running the
      final sequence now. She didn't take all that well, so I don't want
      to make her too suspicious in case something backfires on us. What
      I'm doing is giving her false memories for the present sequence,
      something to stop her getting suspicious about the amount of time
      she's spending asleep these days.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;And where do I come into all this?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Well, the most obvious memories to give her, to explain what she
      was doing in bed, is to put another girl in there with her.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;And Janice refused to do the work for you, and you couldn't do
      it yourself without more time to work in, so you called for me
      instead. How much are you paying for this essential work?&#8221;</p>

    <p>Guy hesitated. He had not considered that aspect of the problem
      &#8212; and he doubted that he could persuade Valerie by appealing to her
      political sentiment: she had none to speak of. He was trapped in
      the situation, having already committed himself by putting one
      specific girl into the conditioning tapes.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Fifty plaques, no more, he said, grabbing a figure from the
      air.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;One hundred. Let's be reasonable, and have a round number. Have
      you no sense of aesthetics?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;OK, OK, don't rush.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I shan't. Cash please, now. Then we can talk business.&#8221; Knowing
      that he had no threat to hold over the girl, Guy signed the credit
      over to her.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Let's have a look at her, then.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;She's just as we left her, fully dressed, but under a contact
      cap. She won't notice anything when you undress her. The only
      hassle will come when you have to take the helmet off, hide it, and
      get into position, all before she begins to take notice. She's
      drugged a bit, but whatever they did when they designed her has
      given her a fantastic resistance to drugging, so I wouldn't trust
      that too far.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Thanks a load. I wish you had told me about this a little
      earlier, though &#8212; I prefer at least to know in advance who I'm
      going to be sleeping with.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;But it's all in the cause.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Big deal. One girl. I hope you weren't thinking of calling me in
      for all n-thousand of them. Where is she?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;In the bedroom. This way.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Nancy followed their approach, every step a threat to her, her
      safety and her integrity. and yet she was intrigued by this girl
      Valerie who was to lie with her. She had not seen her face or
      figure, save through the intermediary of Guy's eyes, and her
      contact there was poor, and in that way had found out only that her
      hair was brown.</p>

    <p>The door to the bedroom opened, and from her viewpoint, Nancy
      saw herself sprawled clumsily on the bed, a filigreed mesh of
      bright metal among the silver of her hair. She tried to move, but
      could not. Until the cap was removed, she would be helpless,
      totally at the mercy of anything that her captors purposed for her.
      Through Valerie's senses, she noted Guy's interest, and tried to
      cringe.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Like screwing a black-and-white photograph,&#8221; she declared. &#8220;Well,
      business is business. Clear out.&#8221;</p>

    <p>And when Guy was gone, Valerie bolted the bedroom door. Nancy
      noticed that, and modified her plans accordingly. It would give her
      just that extra margin of time in which to act, though the game
      would be just as all-or-nothing as before. She watched
      disinterestedly as she was undressed, only caring really that she
      saw where the necklet was placed.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Any moment now, Tricia,&#8221; she called down the link, pouring a
      great weight of regret and sadness to her mind-partner at that
      thought. Valerie paused to examine her involuntary partner, before
      discarding her own attire. Hiding the cap quickly, she realized,
      was the problem, but simply throwing the thing under the bed should
      suffice. She lay down beside the still form, and examined the
      fixing of the cap.</p>

    <p>Nancy felt the gentle touch of fingertips across her scalp, the
      scratching of the wire meshes, and then the cap was torn from her
      head.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Tricia, Tricia, I love you!&#8221; she called down the fast fading
      connection. She would have said more, but there was not time. She
      was alone in her own head again, totally trapped by a form of flesh
      ridden by chemicals, with a stranger girl on top of her.</p>

    <p>Still, her mind was clear, despite the sluggishness of her body,
      and she acted. But the flesh was still weaker than the spirit was
      willing, and instead of throwing the girl from, her, all she did
      was writhe under Valerie's warm body. There was enough residual
      drowsiness about her to tempt her to stay and enjoy this stroke of
      good fortune, rather than immediately to escape from this
      threat.</p>

    <p>That was good, she muttered, to keep up the pretence. Valerie
      kissed her, and they embraced tightly. And as soon as they were
      locked in that embrace, Nancy made her move, rolling them both from
      the bed, with Valerie landing up on the bottom of the heap.</p>

    <p>Being forewarned about it, Nancy recovered from the instant's
      disorientation and winding before her partner, enough time for her
      to disentangle her hands and get them around the other girls
      throat, and to lean her weight on them.</p>

    <p>Valerie thrashed, and made a few loud, half vocalized noises,
      the difficulty with which she made them indicative of the
      effectiveness of the attack. But she was taller, and stronger than
      Nancy, and her struggles, even from a position of disadvantage,
      were almost enough to free her from the desperate hold. As her air
      ran out, and she felt she must surely choke, Valerie reached up and
      tried in turn to strangle Nancy, but by then, she had pinned one
      arm, and the grip on her throat was a mere discomfort.</p>

    <p>It took a long time for Valerie's struggles to quieten, a time
      during which Nancy was many times nearly thrown free, and during
      which she was ever fearful of intrusion, despite the locking of
      the door. Yet even when her victim lay still, she continued the
      hold, just in case the girl was faking unconsciousness.</p>

    <p>She breathed deeply and raucously when Nancy released the grip,
      but did not stir. Not wishing to take any chances, Nancy moved
      hurriedly, taking up her necklet and her coveralls in one bundle,
      and tiptoed over to the panel in the far wall marked <strong>Fire
        Escape</strong>, moving with a stooped stance like some half-ape
      ancestor.</p>

    <p>The panel fell away from the supports that had held it tight,
      with a brittle snapping of restraining bars, and end-over-end it
      tumbled down, auraed in red by the active field of the fire escape.
      Ringlight glinted from the splintered ends of the glass rods that
      had held the panel, and tingled as it fell on her bare skin. The
      thousand foot drop, the framework of the tower were a flat pencil
      sketch, with perspectives distorted.</p>

    <p>A sudden vertigo made her head spin, and the air was chill about
      her. For milliseconds that seemed to be minutes, she contemplated
      the fall before her, the assurances of her intellect now overcoming
      the animal fears of her mind, before the din of the warning hooter,
      muffled though it might be by the field, but loud enough yet to
      waken the dead, hammered its way through her distraction.</p>

    <p>She scrambled out of the door, hanging at arms length from the
      sill, and swinging herself under the apartment. She had to get out
      of sight before the cause of the alarm was discovered, and the
      bedroom door broken down. But what swing she had gained was soon
      dissipated in the viscous medium, and she was forced to try to
      swim, but it was no different to trying to swim in normal air.
      Under the influence of the safety field, only vertical motion,
      under gravity, was affected, impeded, and the air was made only to
      impede motion, not allow it. And with those constraints upon her,
      her transverse progress was painfully slow.</p>

    <p>So slow indeed, that she was: almost too late. Guy arrived first
      at the open panel, carrying a stunner in his hand, and Nancy was
      yet a yard from getting out of his sight as he leaned down. The
      beam reached for her, but only clipped her legs, and was without
      effect.</p>

    <p>Janice's voice, echoing strangely in the field, its tonal
      qualities grossly distorted by its acoustic side-effects, announced
      her arrival, and she joined Guy in the hatchway. She fired calmly
      at Nancy, weighing the increased accuracy of the aim against the
      rapid disappearance of the target, and almost won the gamble. A
      tangline coil splattered against a girder, wrapping it up in a
      pallid white cocoon, its point of impact mere inches from her
      legs.</p>

    <p>For the moment, she was safe, and the time came for decisions,
      time to guess whether they would try to recapture her, or opt
      simply to kill her, before they succeeded.</p>

    <p>They had the choices of either following her down outside the
      tower, or racing down in the central gravshaft and catching her as
      she drifted down like an autumn leaf. Against this, Nancy could
      play either to remain outside and dodge the attacks, hiding behind
      the supporting engineering, or heading for the gravshaft and taking
      that way herself.</p>

    <p>She set up the game matrix in her head, making up the payoff
      values much off the top of her head, and decided that the matts
      profited by taking the shaft, and her play relied on her choosing
      the safer of her two choices under those circumstances. She opted
      for the centre. That would end the game faster, and would give her
      opponents less time in which to prepare for her.</p>

    <p>She passed close to one of the beams, and grabbed hold of it,
      changing the direction of her fall in the few instants for which
      she held, drifting now more in the direction of the central core.
      She hoped that her analysis of the situation was sufficiently
      detailed, that enough conditions were satisfied for the reasoning
      to be valid. There were no obvious omissions, only the oppressive
      need to be right, first time, or not at all.</p>

    <p>The only flaw she could identify in the reasoning was that those
      opposing her take only one strategy. They could play as many as
      they had personnel and weapons &#8212; two at least, three if Valerie was
      sufficiently recovered. She looped the necklet over her head, and
      threw away the coveralls, to collect them at the bottom. It was
      time to to panic now, and she would prefer not to be cluttered.</p>

    <p>She looked up. Alone, Guy drifted into sight in pursuit of her.
      She guessed that that would mean that Janice would be taking the
      gravshaft, arriving at the bottom long before she would. The
      fire-escape was only a simple comparatively fail-safe device, the
      shaft-fields were more sophisticated, the simplest difference being
      that the shaft could make one go up against gravity.</p>

    <p>That idea, was crazy enough to be worth the try. The nearly
      mile-high tower would be amply sufficient to lose two or three
      searchers in; and if she could find someone in the tower who owned
      a hang-glider &#8212; or if she could tempt all three to head up at her,
      for her to dive past at the highest velocity she could attain. That
      decision would be kept until she reached the tower core. The
      problem was now how to reach that place.</p>

    <p>There was now almost a race on, an incredible slow progress
      through the loose forest of girders, as Guy struggled to locate
      Nancy in the shadows through the red markerhaze that clung about
      him, and obscured his sight, preventing necessary dark adaptation,
      and Nancy wriggled and writhed towards the structural beams, so
      that she could halt her fall and drag herself arm over arm to the
      central shaft.</p>

    <p>Guy won the race, and while Nancy was still a few feet short of
      her goal, he saw her clearly in a shaft of light that passed
      through the meshwork, and with a clear line of sight on her he
      could hardly miss. He did, but for the merest instant, and with a
      slight twist of the arm the beam, almost at its full drain, caught
      her square in the body. Yet as far as he could tell, it was totally
      without effect, its power just being absorbed in the blue haze that
      had supplanted the red about the girl. That it was markerhaze, he
      doubted, for it tattered slightly under the blast, but did not
      falter.</p>

    <p>Nancy scarcely noticed the attack, until the blueness engulfed
      her, enhancing the ringlight non-colours, and not competing, as had
      the rosy glow of the field haze; if it had any effect, it was
      negligible besides the wooziness still left over from her last
      drugging. The matts however would not prove so resistant. Now if
      only she could capture the gun, all would be well. The idea
      intrigued her enough to try it, despite her trepidation at the
      thought of closing, with Guy, while totally unarmed.</p>

    <p>The cold metal of the beam she had been struggling for slapped
      against her outreached arm, brushing it aside without changing her
      course. The next one she grasped more tenaciously, swinging around
      until she was falling almost directly to the next one in sequence
      below. She almost landed there, killing most of the twenty feet per
      second of velocity she had acquired. Now, at a more leisured pace,
      she could actually grab hold of the next crossbar, and hang there,
      still.</p>

    <p>She scrambled up to stand there, and looked up at her pursuer. A
      hundred feet above her he was, and committed to a pursuit path,
      without any structures available for him to steer from. That gap
      gave her five seconds to manoeuvre on the beam, still some five
      hundred feet up from the ground, time to prepare herself for what
      she would, do. She might just as well carry through the lunatic
      plan, now, as there would be time enough to stop again later. She
      checked around for other apartments, and saw no other ones in the
      stack she currently occupied for about three hundred feet below
      her.</p>

    <p>As Guy drew level, Nancy sprang from the beam, diving for him as
      he thrashed about to turn and face her. She reached him before he
      had completed the manoeuvre, approaching him from one side.
      Recognizing that under the circumstances it would be more a
      liability than an asset, he threw the stunner away, as Nancy struck
      him feet first. With the object of the fight one out of reach,
      Nancy began to regret her decision, for despite the first kick to
      the head, her opponent was still willing to fight her &#8212; or more,
      from the look of him.</p>

    <p>His hand caught her left ankle, and drew her towards him, her
      struggles availing her nothing. All she could do was continue to
      land weak kicks to head and shoulders with her free leg,
      sacrificing strength for agility, to avoid the capture of the other
      leg. Guy waited for her to tire, riding the blows, content to let
      her remain at extreme range for a little while.</p>

    <p>But Nancy succeeded more than she had realized she would. Their
      combined course drifted them horizontally, across the space to the
      next line of beams, and Guy, being beneath Nancy, and facing
      upwards, was not aware of this until he landed on one, taking the
      force of their combined deceleration. His grip slackened, enough
      for one sweeping kick to the face to free her entirely, and set her
      drifting back.</p>

    <p>She might have gone after the stunner at this point in the
      action, but she had heard it clatter from some piece of structural
      work, off to one side, without any notion of where it had scattered
      to, that idea lost its charm. Besides, it was more entertaining to
      watch Guy tumble limply from the beam, obviously not conscious.</p>

    <p>Her artistic appreciation of the events did not preclude her
      from hearing a sickening slurp as a tangline charge took something
      &#8212; her coveralls, she guessed. From the path of his fall, Guy would
      be next &#8212; he didn't have an apartment below him any more, or so she
      judged. That would amuse the ground crew &#8212; or something. Then
      either she could slip out at a distance while confusion reigned, or
      instead just stay on a crossbar, taking all comers. No, scratch
      that idea. That last victory had been mostly luck and she didn't
      feel like chancing her arm again. She would sneak out like a
      coward, a <cite>modus operandi</cite> that suited her temperament
      so much more closely than the heroics that she had been involving
      herself in.</p>

    <p>She began the landing approach to the apartment, killing her
      velocity in fleeting contacts with crossbars as she had before, for
      it was as much important to her not to make an excessive noise as
      it was not to endanger her personal comfort by making a poor
      landing at high velocity.</p>

    <p>With more room to play with, she let herself roll as she hit.
      The rooftop was finely gravelled, like coarse sandpaper, and
      scoured at her skin, but did no more than leave white scrape-marks.
      It was no discomfort to stand on it in bare feet, but not to sit
      down on in similar attire.</p>

    <p>She dusted herself off, and walked towards the central column.
      There was a small railing, designed to prevent those getting off at
      wrong floor from falling, but she climbed it easily, and opened the
      shaft door. Brightly lit, it extended in severe perspective above
      and below her, distorting her perception of direction for a few
      instants.</p>

    <p>Recovered of her sense of up and down, she punched keys to the
      code for the ground floor, and stepped out into the shaft. Warmly,
      protectively, the fields grasped her, pulling her down at several
      gravities of acceleration, then suddenly reversing at the half-way
      mark, drawing her to a halt at her assigned destination.</p>

    <p>The entry concourse was deserted. Nancy peered out from the
      shaft, looking out into the night, in as much as she could see
      anything through the doors. Against the contrast of illumination,
      she could see that they were not directly guarded. Towards the
      city, a few lamps showed a vehicle park which she would have to
      cross. It was almost empty, and the mercury lights made it a fast
      way to suicide were she to attempt it. Away, there were trees and
      parkland. As the least desperate of the options, she chose that,
      and sprinted out.</p>

    <p>This was the side opposite to the apartment and where she had
      remained during her fall, and Janice was, as she expected, not
      there. Valerie was, and standing right where Nancy would run into
      her. She did. Both went sprawling on the concrete, with Valerie's
      gun falling from her hand, and skating across the rough
      surface.</p>

    <p>Nancy picked herself up and crawled across to it, but fumbled
      her attempt to pick it up and run. Something inside her snapped as
      she panicked, and her mind spiralled away.</p>

    <p>Janice came running at Valerie's involuntary shout, and found
      her picking herself up off the floor.</p>

    <p>&#8220;No, it wasn't her. It was a dog of some sort. She must still be
      up there hiding, Reinforcements?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I suppose we'll have to. Stay here. I'll phone from the car &#8212;
      and don't let her jump you like that animal did.&#8221;</p>

    <hr />
    <p>Almost within sight of those events, Vors k'Shammarra was far
      less happy that he would have been, had he been observing them. He
      had diverted his prime force to searching for Nancy, but without
      much in the way of trail to follow, and without any information
      from those responsible &#8212; not even a claim of responsibility, let
      alone negotiations with the Clans; and none from the prisoners from
      last night's fiasco, it was no surprise that so little progress had
      been made.</p>

    <p>And there was that worrying business about the attack on Castle
      Wolf. Serious though the loss of five cybersoldiers might be, he
      did not care for the local commander's decision to cease all but
      the slightest of attacks, and call repeatedly for reinforcements to
      make up for that loss. He had made his decision, and would abide by
      it, just to spite the man. Not being an employee, however
      tenuously, of his, and not being native to this world, there was
      little he could hold over him in the way of threat. Not that at
      that late juncture, it really mattered. DawnCastle would soon be
      lifting, and the troops from there could go in as the
      reinforcements so many times demanded. But it would be too late now
      for there to be much chance of actually cracking one of these
      strongholds. It served only as an outlet of feeling.</p>

    <p>He would let the people play at toy soldiers. As for himself, he
      had more profitable projects underway to occupy his time.</p>
