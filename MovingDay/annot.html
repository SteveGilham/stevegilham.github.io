    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>There are several sorts of comments here. Explanations as I framed them in
      1976&#8211;7 when this was written (first draft in '76, redrafted and expanded in
      '77); how I might have written it starting in 2000, how the science and
      speculation has held up and suchlike, and again in 2023. I shan't attempt to self lit-crit or
      comment about the adolescent angst - or horniness.</p>

    <p>The tale is a &#8220;secret origin&#8221; story, setting up a character who would be
      my take on the Telzey Amberdon meme; but I never quite got settled what her
      &#8220;super power&#8221; would be, and ended up with three.</p>

    <p>The name comes from a nod to Ruth Blackett, from <cite>Swallows and
        Amazons</cite>, another to <cite>the Lord of the Rings</cite>, and Wolf 'cos
      it's kewl.</p>

    <h2>Prologue</h2>
    <dl>
      <dd><a id="outreach"><strong>Human Outreach</strong></a></dd>
      <dt>A grand name for the wave of interstellar colonization. The time-line
        runs roughly thus &#8212; c2040, space industry and colonization becomes
        economically feasible, and by the end of the century, large ramscoops had
        started out the usual suspects within 6&#8211;7 parsecs of the Sun. FTL travel
        (modelled on the spindizzies from Blish's <cite>Cities in Flight</cite>)
        were acquired by trading with other civilizations some centuries down the
        line. The setting as given uses this (and some other slow-FTL drives) to
        establish footholds. Developed systems can then be tied into the mainstream
        by the Linker based instantaneous gate-to-gate travel. This one is stolen
        from the SPI game <cite>Starforce.</cite> Indeed that whole trilogy of
        games (<cite>OutReach</cite> and <cite>StarSoldier</cite> being the other
        two) furnished input to this future history.</dt>
      <dd><a id="ADT"><strong>ADT</strong></a></dd>

      <dd><a id="Lindisfarne"><strong>Lindisfarne</strong></a></dd>
      <dt>It's a planet in the white-earth state; the perspective of the year
        2000 suggests that the environmental control involves pumping plenty of
        water-vapour, methane and other short-lived greenhouse gases into the
        atmosphere. This state is akin to current thinking on the state of
        Neoproterozoic (late Precambrian) Earth, 700Myr ago.<br />
        In [2023], we have real exoplanets, rather than rolled on the <a
          href="https://stevegilham.github.io/Tinesware/acreteScript.html">Dole model</a>
        ones and &tau; Ceti f, the 4th of 4 detected to date, fits the cold super-earth
        niche (surface gravity ~1.2g, orbit reaching outside the habitable zone) quite nicely.
      </dt>
      <dd><a id="feudal"><strong>Feudal system</strong></a></dd>
      <dt>This one is the concept from Niven's <cite>A Gift from Earth</cite>
        taken to a further degree</dt>
      <dd><a id="Luthien"><strong>Luthien</strong></a></dd>
      <dt>This one I had pencilled in for the first contact encounter, and the
        acquisition of the twirl (spindizzy) drive.</dt>
      <dd><strong><a id="lite">Lites</a></strong></dd>
      <dt>A lite is a light-year.</dt>
      <dd><a id="webofman"><strong>Web of Man</strong></a></dd>
      <dt>In function, an interstellar Internet, rather like Vinge's Qeng Ho net,
        only more planetary civilization than trader-ship based. Still radio or
        communications laser in this epoch; inward traffic would be the relaying of
        results from cheap large aperture telescopes carried by surveying or
        first-wave colony ships, looking out to systems beyond their destinations,
        and colonial discoveries. Outbound traffic would be technological advances
        (though by this stage things would be well onto the top of a sigma
        curve).</dt>
      <dd><a id="Wyvern"><strong>Wyvern</strong></a></dd>
      <dt>This is one of the genre tropes &#8212; planets have almost-earthlike
        biochemistry, biology and ecology. Part of the secret history of the
        setting has a &#8220;war in heaven&#8221; about 30Myr ago that explains why there are
        only emerging civilizations now. Year 2000 speculations are that perhaps in
        the real deep past, this convergence of biology was engineered, perhaps
        600Myr back</dt>

        <cite>If the Stars are Gods</cite>. The conceit is that the appearance of
        the people of Clan Wolf is such that they don't look different in a black
        &amp; white photograph.

      <dd><a id="ritual"><strong>ritual</strong></a></dd>
      <dt>It was about three years before writing this that I'd read
        <cite>Gormenghast</cite>. It shows.

    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <dl>
      <dd><a id="NancysRoom"><strong>Nancy's room</strong></a></dd>
      <dt>This is a composite of a number of rooms observed during student days
        in the late 70s, with a few high-tech frills. It's not simply my own
        squalor that's on display here.<br />
        Some of the high-tech is still &#8216;magic&#8217;; but I lost big-time on guessing
        about computing. There is home automation which has strong AI, but Nancy's
        display screen is a sophisticated dumb terminal link to a logical central
        mainframe (which may be a number of distributed processors). Personal
        computing power &#8212; or portable telecommunications &#8212; are missing.<br />
        View the cassette/crystals as MP3 in some fancy optical storage medium.</dt>
      <dd><a id="Sexuality"><strong>Sexuality</strong></a></dd>
      <dt>You have an extended family of what would be clones, were there not a
        little bit of deliberately engineered differences, and they have been part
        of a system of apartheid which viewed everything not family as less than
        human. The line between both incest or homosexuality and masturbation blurs
        when outgroup sexuality gains connotations of bestiality (or at least
        <dfn title="Sex between different hominid species, from Larry Niven's _Ringworld_">rishathra</dfn>). No explicit
        sex here &#8212; I didn't feel qualified to
        write any at the time, and these days, I don't feel inclined to add to the
        pool of mediocre smut on line. The rest of the internet
        is there if that's what you're after. Or, as the Stranglers put it, use
        your twentieth century imagination, if you've got any, that is.
      </dt>
      <dd><a id="Earth"><strong>Earth</strong></a></dd>
      <dt>When I wrote this, my image of Earth twelve centuries hence was of a
        somewhat backwards, bucolic sort of place &#8212; images of post-Imperial England
        here. An idea for a later Nancy Wolf story had her eventually arriving on
        Earth, and I have a scene in mind of her sitting by the light of a late
        spring full moon, looking up at the masses of Lagrange colonies and those
        further afield in solar orbit near the Earth, from Castle Hill in
        Cambridge, a Cambridge that was more 17th century with unobtrusive high
        tech. If I were to revise this universe today, Earth would have undergone
        some Singularity, as per Swanwick's <cite>Vacuum Flowers</cite> or the
        Nanoclysm in Adam Warren's <cite>Dirty Pair</cite> and the real magitech
        would be the results of limited commerce between Earth and human-level
        entities. Linkers would be the most comprehensible form of Transhuman,
        beneath orders which I will refer to as Seraphim, who start out
        incomprehensible and work in mysterious ways up from there.<br />

      <dt>I wrote as someone who thought in Imperial measure. Units used by the

      <dt>There is serious but understated biotech here; the change is a major
        phenotype re-engineering &#8212; deep biochemical changes as well as shifting
        bone and muscle. Alas, such a substitution would be easy to spot with
        techniques akin to traffic analysis (even if one just didn't compare lists
        of students before and after). How mannerisms and other identification
        techniques based on gait and similar features would be preserved through
        the change is open.</dt>

      <dt>There is a fair amount of crypto in this tale, all done in hardware
        with props gathered from 60s spy films; looking back at the story, the file
        referred to here would be simply encrypted under some hefty conventional
        algorithm (perhaps One Time Pad) and decrypted by some hardware token. The
        scrambler used later would also be an OTP, perhaps with some SSL-like
        negotiation in order to establish the starting offset into the pad.</dt>

          information-theoretic death</a>, can be cured with prompt enough treatment. Getting into such a
        moribund state counts as being killed; but you can get better &#8212; if you
        haven't succumbed to information-theoretic death as in this case. Then you
        are dead. And in a society of emortals, this is not good news.

      <dt>The economic system implicit in the story is like the one from many of
        Mack Reynolds' stories. It's an economy of abundance. Everyone gets some
        basic income, enough for a spartan life; but you can gain extra credit for
        economically useful activity. The Clans have acquired credit from the
        Linkers' Guild for terraforming, they in turn gain it from their transport
        function. And compound interest still works.</dt>

        nanotech smart matter, and within the setting it would be a black box gift
        from the Seraphim and other Transcended beings via the Linkers. I assume
        that there are mechanisms preventing unrestricted Nanoclysms. The Linkers
        must run a covert BTR.</dt>

          Climber's Guide to Trinity College</cite> in the University Library,
        written as an undergraduate by some-one who went on to academic
        respectability (perhaps even becoming Master of the College); here that
        tradition gets obliquely linked to Steerpike's traverse of Gormenghast.

    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>

    <p>A lot of student life here; or at least a composite of the way things were

      <dt>I can't remember when the famous worm happened compared with when I was
        writing this (it was in the '76 draft). I do remember as an undergraduate
        having heard of people communicating by computer network from the US to the
        Computer Lab at Cambridge, usually from people who pulled all-nighters
        suddenly getting message on their terminal asking &#8220;Where have I managed to
        connect to?&#8221;. These were the same folk also mentioned in the context of
        late night hacking exploits into the local home-grown operating system, the
        so called Key Zero club.<br />
        Nancy is clearly in the local Key Zero club, and has been getting out onto

        deteriorated from disuse from the level that got me marked down bad
        handwriting at school, to where it would need serious AI to decode from
        context &#8212; certainly the current 2003 TablePC handwriting recognition
        will pick up some words, but often turns input into,&hellip; well I
        guess &quot;poetry&quot; is probably the most positive description of

        of Jeanne's directness might be considered unparliamentary, then assume

      <dt>This is implicitly a &#8220;sensible Libertarian&#8221; type of future, at least in
        terms of most personal conduct; at the University, part of the contract is
        that they handle security matters. As for how come there aren't various
        security scanners &#8212; partly, there is a culture of trust that has only
        recently been subverted, and partly due to interesting materials. I can't
        remember if in '77 I had given much thought to the latter idea &#8212; plastic
        and ceramics, though it was definitely possible. The home-made weapons
        referred are definitely not just zip-guns, but manufactured to proper specs
        with readily available home workshop tools, so I probably had some idea
        along those lines. The original draft had some comment about Nancy
        wondering about how some of the guns had been snuck into the dining
        hall.<br />
        As an aside, it is interesting to note that the AK-47 is simple enough to
        build that it is an output of a cottage industry in southern Asia these
        days.</dt>

      <dt>As noted, a variant on Blish's spindizzy, with many of the same
        behaviours. At low levels (compared with those needed for moving the whole
        castle) such as this, we have the visual &#8220;special effect&#8221;, the imparting of
        a significant upward impulse to anything material trying to pass, and the
        tendency to disperse high concentrations of energy attempting to pass. We
        see this when the defence laser is stopped at the field.</dt>

      <dd><strong><a id="Sapphire">Sapphire</a></strong></dd>
      <dt>One of the few bits of the text I have amended; the hands-on
        interaction with the computer was extremely simple in the original &#8212; well
        simpler when compared with having to craft JCL to run a program so as to be
        able to invoke a delete-on-terminate handler in order to delete a file. The
        various coloured permutations on green-screen terminal mode used by people
        accessing this file later in the text I've left for period flavour.</dt>

      <dt>They're using geosynchronous relays, not low orbit systems like
        Iridium, so a mobile unit would be far bulkier, and not pocket-sized. UV
        beams would be high bandwidth and low side-lobes, so eavesdropping would be
        difficult. But you'd only want to use it at high altitude when you're above
        the most strongly absorbing parts of the atmosphere.<br />
        I saw the screen about 10&#8211;15cm on a side, the keyboard icon as a simple 3x3
        array of squares, and the bell icon as a maybe 8x8 pixel thing across that
        size of screen</dt>
      <dd><strong><a id="FreeTraders">Free Traders</a></strong></dd>
      <dt>This is not to be taken as being against free trade as <cite><a href="http://www.economist.com/">the
            Economist</a></cite> would define it;
        the Free Traders are those who ply trade off the beaten tracks defined by
        the Linker network. Often this means goods carried clandestinely between
        systems served by the Linkers. Freebooters is probably the more accurate,
        but less tactful, name.</dt>
      <dd><strong><a id="HanChiaki">Han-Chiaki</a></strong></dd>
      <dt>It would require too much AWAK-ing in line to explain that this is a
        Hrulgani ethnicity &#8212; extees are poly-cultural too! There is a
        pseudo-Chinese implication in this culture, but the Han part is accidental
        (I didn't know at the time of writing that this was the name of the Chinese
        ethic group).</dt>

    <h2>Chapter 5</h2>

    <p>I have amended the text (or to be precise, dialogue) in a couple of places
      this chapter, more than simply making sentences broken by writing to a fixed
      medium from flow-of-consciousness, into more grammatical structures. The
      significant places are in the bickering between Jeanne and the Councillor
      (which has been made somewhat more mature); and in the description of what
      happens when one messes with Transcendent artifacts.</p>

    <p>One notes that man-portable sensory enhancements &#8212; particularly IR and
      millimetre wave technology &#8212; don't appear to be in regular use. Nancy does
      use something like an anonymous remailer net towards the end of the
      chapter.</p>
    <dl>
      <dd><strong><a id="number2">2</a></strong></dd>
      <dt>The code &#8216;1&#8217; is &#8212; or was &#8212; of course that of Lady Trixy herself. And
        there has to be an end-of-code symbol to follow for this non-hierarchic
        system.</dt>
      <dd><strong><a id="Kimberley">Mike Kimberley</a></strong></dd>
      <dt>It was my intention that Mike is of Native Australian stock.</dt>
      <dd><strong><a id="QlHrui">Q'l-Hrui</a></strong></dd>
      <dt>Another improvement from the scanner. Though it does like the letter Q
        when not simply degrading into punctuation.</dt>
      <dd><strong><a id="RadiationAccident">Radiation accident</a></strong></dd>
      <dt>In comics-book parlance, this is the radiation accident, the
        radioactive spider, the cosmic rays, whatever catalyst required to unleash
        our hero's super powers. I wanted Nancy to be, like Telzey, a psi outside
        the organized society of such folk, and so needed an unorthodox method to
        jolt her powers from latency. What I didn't intend was this to become the
        staff that became an Uru Hammer &#8212; but it had ideas all of its own on that
        score.</dt>
      <dd><strong><a id="Continuity">Continuity of
            Consciousness</a></strong></dd>
      <dt>This was, of course, long before I encountered Daniel Dennett, and his
        work &#8212; and how consciousness is of necessity fractured and
        discontinuous.</dt>
    </dl>

    <h2>Chapter 6</h2>

    <p>This is where the guiding precept &#8220;No plan survives contact with the
      enemy&#8221; comes into play. The radiation accident continues, as I try to figure
      out what the artifact might actually be or do. The blaster works with
      cartridges of &#8220;slow glass&#8221; bound under some gravitic standing field, which
      are pushed through a phase transition to release the stored energy</p>

    <p>The chapter is also noted for its graphic vomiting scene.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 7</h2>

    <p>This is where we get to see a little more of the casual use of space
      technology; and the appearance of some different faction amongst the matts.
      The Patti Hearst case was, IIRC, an influence in this plot device of memetic
      engineering.</p>

    <p>We also get to see civilian life in this society; the minimal impact
      including housing in ultra-high tower blocks; but when you can buy a floor
      large enough to build a house and garden in if you want, and without being
      crowded by neighbours, the evils of the 1970s could be mitigated.</p>

    <p>We note that the &#8220;yuppies&#8221; do have something close to cell-phones. Very
      time-of-writing.</p>

    <p>Kingarra, the starfish, is of a race drawn from Olaf Stapledon's
      <cite>Star Maker</cite>
    </p>

    <p>The flashback scenes are a bit Andre Norton meets RQ.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 8</h2>

    <p>The memetic programming is me trying to write evil or horror. Compared
      with e.g. Bret Easton Ellis, it's of course tame. But I plead that I intended
      to use understatement (and that good old 20<sup>th</sup> century
      imagination).</p>

    <p>The escape from the Snowflake uses an implied threat &#8212; &#8220;Incapacitate the
      pilot of this ship, and say good-bye to most of the population below&#8221;. A
      desperation tactic.</p>

    <p>At the start Nancy was a latent werewolf, living on a world where it's
      always full moon. Hence all the foreshadowing, about the effects of the
      ring-light upon her and her state of mind. Here, she makes the transition for
      the first time. And I was being misleading above, when I said baldly Wolf
      'cos it's kewl.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 9</h2>

    <p>Being a wolf would have misled infrared traces &#8212; she would have been
      detected and then passed over as not being human. Clearly the two matts
      walking past aren't using any such devices actively as they pass.</p>

    <p>With most infrastructure service operations automated, there is little
      impetus to get up early for work in this culture; but there might be joggers
      and such.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 10</h2>

    <p>So now we have Nancy set up for a whole string to tales. Cut loose from
      home, free to wander, loaded, a novice telepath and unwitting werewolf (just
      see the sequel). Just that damned necklet to foul things up.</p>

    <h2>Epilogue</h2>

    <p>As prologue.</p>
