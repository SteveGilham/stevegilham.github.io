      <p>The Clan Wolf is one of the few surviving feudal houses of the
        <a href="annot.html#outreach">Human Outreach</a>. Founded on
        Lindisfarne (<a href="https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exoplanet-catalog/7180/tau-ceti-f/">Tau Ceti IV</a>) by the
        Lady Surveyor Trixy Linda of Wolf
        (see also Human Outreach &#8212; Folktales; The Madwoman of Lindisfarne)
        in 2133 <a href="annot.html#ADT">ADT</a>, it has survived basically
        unchanged to the present.
      </p>

      <h2>History.</h2>

      <p>During the period of preliminary survey of Lindisfarne, it was
        considered necessary to construct citadels to which the colonists
        could withdraw during the <a href="annot.html#Lindisfarne">harsh
          winters</a>, before suitable environmental control could be
        established. Trixy Wolfe, as she was then known, is supposed to
        have likened them to Mediaeval Castles, and then coerced the other
        surveyors into setting up a <a href="annot.html#feudal">feudal
          society</a>, where they would be the nobility. Though recent
        findings place the responsibility with Mark of Connors, it is
        likely that Ms. Wolfe supported him.</p>

      <p>After nearly a century, while most of the noble houses had
        relinquished all but nominal sovereignty, Clan Wolf persisted in a
        firm and often cruel government. Attempts were made to depose the
        clan by force, but all were brutally crushed at Trixy's behest.
        These repressions caused the situation to deteriorate, until the
        eventually successful coup led by Matthew Hayward erupted.</p>

      <p>The majority of the Clan, and the remainder of Clan Connors fled
        the world, to the HR 5568 system, where there was known to be a
        borderline habitable world, surveyed but not yet colonized. They
        arrived but a fortnight before the colony ships from earth, armed
        with the equipment that would subdue the world. They moved on again
        as soon as their task was done, their prior experience of a cold
        world no longer required, before those who feared tyrannical
        excesses could expel them.</p>

      <p>They had tired of cold and wintry worlds. Warm and summery <a href="annot.html#Luthien">Luthien</a> was their
        goal, seventy <a href="annot.html#lite">lite</a>s further from Sol, the news less
        than a year before passed to them alone the relays of the <a href="annot.html#webofman">Web of Man</a>. But
        though they fled,
        their infamy still remained. Those who had feared them claimed
        victory, that the Clan, guilty, had fled justice.</p>

      <p>On Luthien, the Clan, among others, formed the Five Castles
        Combine, and the article on the Combine gives a more detailed
        history of this period. Suffice it to say that the eventual
        colonists challenged the Combine's right under the new Linkers'
        Guild to govern the world. Matthew Hayward's ghost seemed to rise
        to rally the forces of unrest against them there, and on Heartward,
        Toehold and Last Gasp.</p>

      <p>Presently, Clan and Combine are resident on Wyvern, their
        seventh world, their policy, as stated, is to preserve that world
        in as close to its <a href="annot.html#Wyvern">idyllic natural
          state</a> as possible, and this is being opposed by interests
        outside the Combine that prefer a more aggressive approach. It is
        believed that these may in part be responsible for funding the
        renewed Haywardist activity. It is distinctly possible that the
        Clans may be forced once again into exile in the near future.</p>

      <h2>Customs</h2>

      <p>Following Trixy Linda's ideal of a master-race the vast majority
        of the clan are female, ectogenic clones <a href="annot.html#nipped">nipped</a> to display silver hair and
        eyes, grey blood and skin. Within this pattern, only height and
        build vary ; it is difficult for an outsider easily to distinguish
        them. Their feudal past shows in the variety of <a href="annot.html#ritual">ritualized titles and
          observances</a>
        persisting to this day&#8230;</p>
