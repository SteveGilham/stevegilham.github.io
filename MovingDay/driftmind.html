    <p>Morning. At last. Those words were not spoken, nor even framed
      as thoughts. They were just a feeling that ought to have been
      relief, but didn't quite achieve the goal.</p>

    <p>Nancy awake instantly from a feverish sleep, stared dully at the
      ceiling. She felt dull-headed, unclean with dried sweat, and her
      stomach felt raw. Sleep had not refreshed her, and she was too
      leaden limbed to get up and attend to her discomforts.</p>

    <p>She reflected on the course of events that had brought her to
      this sorry state. Six weeks earlier &#8212; such short time &#8212; she
      had been ripped from the quiet routine of her life, and had had her
      mind worked over by a relic of ancient intelligence, and a
      subversive group dedicated to the dispersal of her clan. Unable to
      fit back in her old life, she had tried to make a clean break,
      start a new life, resume the education that had been interrupted
      elsewhere.</p>

    <p>Now she could see how forlorn that hope had been. She was a
      different person now. The combined assault on her mind had done
      more than awaken the empathic traits that a first examination had
      revealed. They had, incidentally, uncaringly, ruptured brittle
      structures in her personality. Darknesses, once hidden beyond her
      own knowledge now seeped through to the surface.</p>

    <p>What periods of happiness she had enjoyed seemed to be briefer,
      shallower than before. Even the excitement of exploring her new
      senses had been marred by the intervention of a malignant mentality
      wishing to possess her, to itself become Nancy Wolf. She had died,
      albeit briefly, under its attack, and yet had brought herself back
      to life. That had been ten days before, and in that time she had
      more than once found herself regretting that &#8216;happy&#8217; ending.
    </p>

    <p>Last night had been one such time, and she had used a party to
      which she had been invited as an excuse to drown her sorrows in
      drink. The attempt had failed miserably, with the drink and the
      happiness of the other revellers turning her thoughts inwards, and
      though the memories had been blurred in the recording she recalled
      long and detailed expositions of her personal woes that she had
      recounted to perfect strangers, until finally, puking and raving,
      she had been escorted to bed by the girl with whom she had been
      partnered.</p>

    <p>And now, she must face the morning after. She cast away the one
      sheet that remained on her bed, and staggered to her feet, pausing
      for a few vertiginous instants as her circulation adapted itself to
      her new posture, before discarding the underwear in which she had
      slept, and heading for the bathroom. A hot bath would take care of
      most of her discomforts, and there would doubtless be something in
      the medical supplies that would be appropriate for her stomach.</p>

    <p>Between the tasteless slurry that had been dispensed for her
      stomach, and the relaxing warmth of the bath, Nancy drowsed,
      catching up on the sleep she had lost, only to be jolted from the
      tranquillity of non-thought by the door-buzzer. She fought petty
      anger at the person responsible, but failed to stem its evil tide,
      and with a hate in her heart that the mask of her expression only
      concealed, she went to answer he call.</p>

    <p>The tall avian steward waiting at the door did not react visibly
      to the towel-wrapped, dripping figure that answered</p>

    <p>&#8220;Lady Wolf?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; Coldly, Nancy noticed how she filled that word with
      hate and spat it out.</p>

    <p>&#8220;A package for you. Sign here.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Anger gave way to curiosity, and it was excitement that spread
      her signature untidily across the form.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; she called, distractedly, as she shut the door
      again.</p>

    <p>Asprawl on her bed, she examined the package, a small box, four
      inches by five, and three quarters of an inch deep. The address
      label was printed, and postmarked from the next system Earthwards
      of the current position of this liner. Nancy could think of no one
      she knew or had ever known who could have sent something to her
      from there.</p>

    <p>She cut the seal open with her thumbnail, and scattered the
      contents out onto the sheets. Freed from its wad of packaging, a
      small pendant glittered there, a square of bright metal set with a
      pale-blue transparent gem. Disbelieving, Nancy looked to her
      bedside table where the original lay, its gem indigo, not
      cornflower blue. She sought explanation from the small envelope
      which had remained in the box. It contained a note handwritten on a
      sheet of cream toned paper.</p>

    <p>'If you know this, then your time is come. I may have been
      delayed a few million years, but now, I have you.'</p>

    <p>In place of signature there were three whorls of glowing gold
      light, like fingerprints woven into the page.</p>

    <p>Before reading, Nancy had been sliding into mild hysterical
      shock, while she wove in this seemingly impossible gift. Now she
      was only afraid. Memories that were not truly hers, that had been
      planted by the indigo gem, stirred to life, memories of the
      previous owner. She had been Vaelithra, High Priestess of the Earth,
      worshipper of light and life, the gem her badge of office, and she
      had known that sign of three.</p>

    <p>The powers of Sky and Earth had not been alone in bestowing aid
      to their faithful: and the spirits of death and destruction had
      matched the powers of life in their generosity, and in the
      teachings of both cults there was the prophecy that at the end of
      time, the two factions would rise in open combat, and bring down
      the curtain. Was this to be that battle, her own self against the
      person or persons who now controlled the opposing holy relics?</p>

    <p>Armageddon, an universal ruin across the cosmos full of galaxies
      unaffected by the original struggle, Nancy could not accept, but
      her own death seemed all too likely. Would she run? She might be
      able to, depending on the sequencing of the Links, but if she had
      been located, it would not be easy &#8212; if indeed it were possible
      &#8212; to shake off pursuit, and to be condemned to eternal flight. She
      would rather die than suffer that tyranny.</p>

    <p>The only alternative was to stand and fight, and she would be
      able to choose where. Ship-board, obviously, was far too fragile an
      environment for any display of force, such as she could recall from
      Vaelithra's memory. The only suitable place would be dirtside, on the
      green Earth, where her own power would be the stronger.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Ship,&#8221; she called, &#8220;This is Nancy Wolf, Cabin
      06&#8211;458. I'm
      pausing my journey here. Have my luggage stowed on board the Link
      station.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Decision registered. Your luggage will be collected in ten
      minutes. Thank you for your custom.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Packing was trivial. One suitcase was filled from her wardrobe,
      the other from the incidental luggage scattered around the cabin.
      All the remaining trash and trinkets were dumped in the bin, and
      that was all. The bath, the half destroyed bed, were all the trace
      she would leave of her passing.</p>

    <p>One last check, one final decision on what to wear, and she
      departed. She travelled light, with only a shoulder-bag to carry
      her minimum of supplies. Anything else, she had money enough to
      buy.</p>

    <hr />

    <p>By the time the shuttle undocked from the link, half an hour
      later, Nancy had a clearer idea of what she would do. Time was her
      most precious resource, her two hour lead over any opponent
      fighting the timetables down the line from the next system, two
      hours that would remain hers until she stopped. Meanwhile, she
      would ignore the oh-so-familiar sight of the link station drifting
      away into the distance, and concentrate on the guidebook she had
      purchased, in case there might be some useful peculiarity of the
      world, something that would work to her advantage.</p>

    <p>The world was called Nalthor, and it was green and summery
      through its year of barely perceptible seasons. It was a world
      slightly smaller than Earth, roughly half of its surface dry land.
      There was only one spaceport &#8212; the population being too small to
      warrant more. That was the first bonus, that her pursuit would be
      constricted a longer time.</p>

    <p>She continued to read, gleaning other interesting snippets of
      information about the world. The population, it seemed clustered in
      a few dozen small cities, in regions free from an almost universal
      jinx that seemed to haunt the world. It had been tamed long before
      the first Partnership vessel had approached it, and had remained
      so. Even the cities had been there then, and had been eagerly
      filled by the incoming colonists. Yet each time an effort was made
      to extend the settlement, every possible disaster had befallen
      it.</p>

    <p>Now, few people left the cities, except to travel by monorail to
      another city and the only other mode of travel used was to go
      afoot. Inevitably the environment would be little different from
      that aboard ship, unsuited to a showdown, unless she were to choose
      the unlucky outside. Final judgement could await access to a decent
      library.</p>

    <hr />

    <p>The landing field was a seemingly endless expanse of concrete,
      uncomfortably bright in the bright sunlight. The sky was too dark
      by Nancy's prejudices, the clouds too wispy, and the gravity
      perceptibly lighter than the shipboard value. Planets seemed a
      little primitive after a long time away, despite her atavistic
      desire for a blue sky and bright sun overhead.</p>

    <p>She shrugged, more with her face than her shoulders, and
      followed the other passengers into the reception hall, a bright
      white construction of corrugated metal where a few officials waited
      to supervise the newcomers. Nancy chose a queue randomly &#8212; there
      was none perceptibly shorter than any other &#8212; and resigned herself
      to the wait.</p>

    <p>The formalities were thankfully brief, and soon she was at the
      head of the queue. The rodent-like creature at the desk sounded
      bored as he asked to see her passport, and asked for a few other
      bits and pieces of information for the files.</p>

    <p>&#8220;The purpose of your visit?&#8221; he asked.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I'm expecting to meet someone here.&#8221; She had none of her
      usual lies ready against that question, and so answered with almost the
      truth. She was greeted by an expression that clearly thought this
      world an unlikely place for rendezvous.</p>

    <p>&#8220;How long will you be staying?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;A day, maybe two. If I survive.&#8221; She symbolized a gun with
      her right hand, held it to her temple &#8212; suicide; that was surely
      what it would be, should she meet her death. The official's expression
      conveyed the opinion that he didn't care to deal with the mentally
      unbalanced.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Too bad. Peace be with you.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Thanks.&#8221;</p>

    <p>As soon as she left the hall, she headed directly for a public
      terminal, and requested the statistical analysis of the jinx that
      the guidebook had mentioned. It was there, and it was large, and
      probably psi-related as it only crippled complex non-organic
      structures.</p>

    <p>So she would just have to choose a city. She requested a map,
      and jabbed her finger randomly at it to decide her final
      destination. The resultant choice had only its name to distinguish
      it from any other possible choice, so there could be no underlying
      drive to choose any other &#8212; only some ramifications of the planet's
      luck manipulating effects.</p>

    <p>Nancy withdrew her credit card, and looked around the reception
      area for signposts. She strolled away from her corner, watching for
      any to appear from behind stairways or ornamental greenery, though
      the hall, easily a hundred yards long, encouraged her to patience:
      if she could not see a sign now, there was plenty of opportunity
      for one later.</p>

    <p>She paused at one of the shops that lined the hall, and bought a
      few books and magazines to read during the journey, bundling them
      into her shoulder-bag, and moving on to a snack bar, where she
      bought a hot meat pasty and a chocolate milk shake. She breakfasted
      as she walked, following the sign that she now could see in the
      distance, directing her to the monorail terminal, up a flight of
      stairs to the catwalk level. She discarded the cup as she climbed,
      letting it drift into a trash-can below.</p>

    <p>There was another receptacle by the ticket machine, where she
      deposited the napkin which had wrapped the pasty, and wiped her
      hands, before tapping the key labelled Halcyon. The plastic tab
      that would permit her the random journey clattered into the
      receiving dish. She picked it up, hesitantly, as if that could
      delay the inevitable. A travel plan appeared on the dispenser
      screen, giving her a choice between the first departing train, and
      the more direct one that would reach the final destination first.
      She decided upon the second, despite the half hour it would hold
      her at the spaceport. She went through to the waiting area, a
      scattering of chairs and tables, with continuous windows on two
      sides allowing a view out onto the field.</p>

    <p>Nancy had no eyes for the comparatively uninspiring aspect, nor
      did she notice the bar, just the clock above it. She sat herself
      down where she could just look up to see the time, and began to
      read one of the books she had bought.</p>

    <hr />

    <p>Once aboard the train, however, she had no taste for reading, or
      for the magazines in her shoulder-bag. She had never travelled so
      fast so close to the ground, and the increased perception of speed
      drew her attention. Out of the city, the line passed through
      forest, and the continuously changing aspect of sun, and trees
      presented a hypnotic display of light.</p>

    <p>The outside air had been cool, but inside the carriage, the
      sunlight was warm. Imperceptibly, Nancy felt her eyes grow heavy,
      beyond her capacity to hold them open.</p>

    <p>Dreams came to her, interwoven with her intermittent glimpses of
      objective reality. And amidst the dreams, there were threads of her
      false memories.</p>

    <p>So when she walked again the woodland path down to river that
      she had known only, yet repeatedly, in her dreams, she was at times
      not herself, but Vaelithra, so that when she turned a bend in the
      river's course, she came across the temple where she had trained.
      There was a sense of the sky darkening as she approached, a threat
      above her. In the distance, behind her, something glowed red, and
      she knew it for the witchfires of the devil cult. Nancy forced
      herself into control of the dream, forced herself to levitate, to
      speed her travel, fighting the unaccustomed resistance she met.</p>

    <p>It was all she could to to lift herself a handsbreadth from the
      ground, and half walk, half drift along, but it brought her to the
      temple itself ahead of the threat. She screamed with her mind as
      she raced along the central path, calling for people long departed,
      the fires of devotion cold, their ashes scattered onto the
      floor</p>

    <p>That shocked the Vaelithra-structure, and Nancy, freed from its
      moulding of her dream ducked out. She stood on the riverbank under
      the sunlight, where it was crossed by a broad belt of grassland,
      between two halves of an old-fashioned city. Two exotic looking
      young women stood nearby, at the door of a small cabin.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Where is the spaceport?&#8221; she asked them.</p>

    <p>&#8220;But this is Halcyon.&#8221; The reply was unnecessary; she knew
      where to go. She struck away from the river, along the highway of
      grass.</p>

    <p>Something startled her awake, and she forced her eyes open. A
      few moments of disorientation went by while she adapted herself to
      the time of day, and realized that the monorail had reached the
      first stop of three <cite>en route</cite> to Halcyon.</p>

    <p>She ordered a jug of sparkling water to help remove the stale
      taste in her mouth, and a somewhat unimaginative lunch to occupy
      her mind for at least part of the next leg of the journey, and
      while she waited she looked around to see her fellow passengers.
      They were a mixed bunch, none of them human &#8212; an Ayassa female in
      traditional kilt, a troupe of shaggy blue spider-monkeys, a number
      of huddled beings in all concealing robes, and some strange being
      in a heavily armoured environment suit. None seemed likely to
      strike up a conversation; and at that moment, she would have
      welcomed anything to take her mind off the reason for making this
      trip at all, and to prevent her dreaming about it. She had been
      unable to think of anything that she could do for herself, and so
      she wished now only to forget what was going on, pretend that
      nothing was wrong, at least until it happened</p>

    <hr />

    <p>It was evening, now. As she looked out of the window Nancy could
      see at last the city of Halcyon, its white spires gleaming in the
      golden light. The monorail itself formed a jewelled thread,
      reaching out from the city, curving wide around the low hill that
      still hid the mass of the city, and out to her</p>

    <p>She gathered together her belongings and turned, impatiently to
      the window, as if she could hurry her arrival by the force of her
      will, although she knew that it would nearly three hours before her
      pursuer could arrive. The same emotional disregard of her cold
      reason left her meagre luggage in a storage locker at the station,
      so being ready for combat. Now all she carried was the key, her
      credit card, and holstered in her right boot the small gun that she
      carried out of habit.</p>

    <p>She wandered restlessly, waiting out the time with growing
      impatience. Occasionally, she opened the defences about her mind.
      to ease the chafing, for all that it forced her into overly
      intimate contact with the swarms of other minds around, and left
      her unclean as she retreated behind the barriers, but there was
      never a trace of hostility directed at her.</p>

    <hr />

    <p>Two hours brought her roughly back to her starting place, having
      traced a path through most of the city. She had decided to have one
      last meal, before&#8230; She realized that even the prospect of
      imminent death did not fill her with the fear that, even a month
      ago, it would have done. But then, she remembered wryly, she had
      died once in that intervening time. She choked back hysterical
      laughter, hanging grimly on to her own version of sanity, and
      forcing her conscious thoughts to the location of a place to
      eat.</p>

    <p>She chose the first restaurant she came to, its one small dining
      room already crowded, and sat down at a corner table for two,
      slightly apart from the general huddle of diners. Their
      conversation came to her, in isolated snippets, intruding into her
      consciousness while she studied the menu. She felt herself
      despising the people to whom she could attribute the dialogue, for
      only so acting out stereotypes. There was one group who were
      obviously tourists, a couple, obviously a mated pair, having a
      soap-opera argument and a number of persons of a very non-human
      race gossiping most intensely, within arm's reach. No one else
      seemed to be dining alone. The bitterness that now seemed to be her
      constant companion welled up inside her, tearing her apart, when
      she resisted the temptation to tears or anger.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Hi! What'll you be having?&#8221; The arrival of a waiter, a
      casually dressed feline woman, turned her attention outwards again. Nancy
      ordered, her choice made off the top of her head.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Fine. Thanks.&#8221; the girl smiled at her before going off with
      the order. Nancy sighed. That girl had been happy in her hobby, and
      friendly: why could people be so open precisely when she could not
      follow that openness up? Was it because of the intimacy associated
      with the provision of food, or a cynical professional openness,
      possible only because any interaction would be transient? Nancy
      could not choose one answer over the other. Hope chose the former,
      so she denied its choice. She felt a tear form at the corner of her
      right eye, and affected an itch to hide the reason that she tended
      to the eye.</p>

    <p>Was this screen of lies that she hid behind something that
      everyone did? Even cynicism could not answer that. It could only
      remind her of her feeling of her own essential hollowness behind
      her facade.</p>

    <p>She didn't even interrupt the train of thought while she faked a
      sorrowful smile for, and accepted her first course from another
      waiter, a human male, who smiled back at her as well. She bore the
      pangs of despair within herself until she was unobserved, and could
      relax her expression. This time her face contorted itself in
      preparation for tears, and, she forced her feelings away, trying to
      return to the good old days before emotional issues arose to
      complicate things, before she had had to feel for herself.</p>

    <p>She sighed, half in regret, half in appreciation of the cold
      tangy taste of her drink, and began to eat greedily, which at least
      beat thinking for entertainment.</p>

    <hr />

    <p>Too soon for Nancy's liking, she could eat no more and would
      once again have to face outside reality. She felt mentally tired as
      she went to pay her bill, too tired even to raise a wan smile as
      she did, and she fled as soon as the transaction was complete.</p>

    <p>The darkness on the street, the jazzy lighting, rolled unnoticed
      off her back, Night, as far as her mood would allow her to be
      concerned, was merely an inevitable fact and the city lights were
      an immediate corollary. She knew that her time of reckoning came
      soon, and some primal impulse decided her to seek out a hidden
      place beyond the city. Later in her wandering, she rationalized her
      choice as being motivated by a desired to protect lives and
      property but at the time, it was pure whimsy upon her part.</p>

    <p>The construct city of small squares, organic-seeming towers,
      elevated boulevards, ended abruptly; beyond the perimeter, only the
      empty land. Her route had taken her south, across the line of the
      monorail, and the final ramp that led her out of the city faced
      south-east. Across to her left, she could see, by the lights in it,
      the last sweep of the monorail into the city. Turning slowly, she
      saw in the east a faint shimmering of light behind thin clouds, and
      a paling of the sky that foretold the rising of a moon. Directly in
      front of her lay a bare grassy hill, and then past it, a swirl of
      pale mist, and the dark shapes of trees. A river; the only
      interesting terrain in the vicinity. Unhurriedly, she walked in
      that direction. She knew she still had enough lead over her pursuit
      to reach it.</p>

    <p>As she passed, she felt, rather than saw, in the starlight, the
      terrain change underfoot, the grass become longer, heaped into
      irregular mounds: that formed an almost impossible surface to walk,
      before merging into a uniform calf-high blanket on the ground. In
      the growing light before moonrise, and her growing adaptation to
      the dark, she could now see to guide her way past obstacles,
      fallen, blasted trees, now only bleached shells, stripped of leaf
      and branch. and between the main avenue of their yet-living
      brothers along the mist-curdled river. There was a chill dankness
      to the scent of the air, and the utmost calm, yet without the sense
      of impending storm &#8212; ironical in the face of what must surely come
      to pass.</p>

    <p>Between the trees, the earth was bare again, save for the debris
      of the last autumn, and the darkness folded her in its cloak,
      hiding her rather than engulfing. Her arcane senses, loosed as she
      passed beyond the city, detected a thread of a call from ahead, as
      from a welcoming beacon, her Vaelithra memories endorsing the faint
      message. In her flight, she could not have been as random as she
      had thought, had instead been following an unconscious hunch to a
      place of possible sanctuary.</p>

    <p>She stared forward into the gloom, to the pale curtain of light
      ahead that was the river. There was no sign of the beckoning place;
      merely the swirls of mist. She hurried forwards to the river, as
      much as the poor seeing allowed, and did not find the crumbling
      earth of a normal riverbank, but a path leading both ways. She
      followed it to her left, and soon ahead a bridge loomed out of the
      mist, a spar of the same not-quite-rock of the path, and she
      crossed it.</p>

    <p>There was a similar path on the far bank, but she spurned it and
      stumbled her way through the trees there, and out into the open,
      spurred on by a feeling of the closeness of her unknown goal. The
      open land came suddenly upon her, and she stopped at the edge of
      its extent. Above her, paralleling the trees, and ultimately the
      river, a line of pylons extended in both directions, as far as she
      could see. Beyond that line, a low hill with a handful of trees on
      its slopes, one standing stark, blasted and dead on the skyline at
      the left, at the contour of some darkness, be it a wall or hedge
      she could not tell. At the summit a number of slender stones were
      arranged in what she guessed was a circle. Pale blue fires played
      around their tips. She now knew what she had been seeking, a safe
      place of the powers allied to Vaelithra's cause. She felt their call,
      and knew that it offered safety for her; and in that same instant
      she felt the hellfire breath of the aura of her pursuer.</p>

    <p>She walked calmly up the hill, knowing. that pursuit could not
      catch her before she had gained the summit, and at the darkness, a
      low wall of dry stone, she turned and looked back to the city. A
      mile away, it did not seem diminished by distance, rather it seemed
      merely to have been given context. It, and the intervening terrain,
      gave no sign of any life, and it did not surprise her that she did
      not see anything. That could wait until she had gained the
      summit.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Hold!&#8221; Nancy wheeled to find the source of that cry, and
      saw, halfway between herself and the summit, a figure indistinct in the
      darkness, and seemingly wreathed in dull red fire, and felt the gem
      at her breast surge into life. She recalled the first time she had
      worn it, how it had caught her up in triumphal song, never since to
      waken. This was like that time, yet weaker, and she too bound to
      her immediate conception of reality to let herself go.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; she called in counter challenge, her voice
      weak in her ears.</p>

    <p>&#8220;My names are many, as well you know, priestess of earth, as
      indeed are yours. They are all irrelevant. Now is our hour.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I don't suppose you're open to reasonable persuasion?&#8221; Nancy
      felt the weakness of her voice change to tiredness as she made her
      final play. The reply was only laughter, floating on the slightest
      of winds.</p>

    <p>Fire gathered in her challenger's darkness, and roared at her,
      passing unnoticing the blue fire that guarded her, and her clothing
      and her flesh, to strike at her spirit. It broke like a storm
      against her mind's defences, and sent pain lancing through her
      whole existence. She screamed in a scream that tore at her throat,
      in pain, misery and fear.</p>

    <p>When she had come to this place expecting death, it had merely
      been the concept of annihilation that she had accepted; she had
      given no though to the many roads that might lead to that end, and
      how many lead through pain. That was what she could not accept. She
      had to struggle, to fight her way clear; and yet she had no
      resources available. The gem she wore had power but it was not hers
      to command, and the time spent in surrender to it was not left to
      her.</p>

    <p>But her body, working far below the level of her conscious mind,
      without the confusion of the two different sets of memory to impede
      it, had already made its own decision.</p>

    <p>From the holster in boot, her gun flew to her hand, sending its
      nerve-deadening effect along a purple tracer beam that reached
      directly, to the flame figure. Such an attack had stripped the
      influence of the gem from her on the night she had acquired it. Yet
      even against the full power of her handgun, the flame burned
      undiminished, and its voice mocked her.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Your toy is irrelevant here! it explained, Watch!&#8221;</p>

    <p>It held forth one hand, and the flame gathered about it,
      brightening, and in the instant, leaping forth to touch the weapon.
      she held. It exploded as the flame touched, the blast sending its
      fragments deep into her flesh. She watched the shredded remains of
      her sleeve, the destruction that had been a hand, waiting for the
      pain to come, a pain she knew would last for the rest of her brief
      life, and looked to her opponent.</p>

    <p>She wanted to call out asking that her death be brief, yet
      remained silent as another attack was prepared. She yearned for it,
      the brief explosion that would tear her from this agonized shell of
      flesh, and yet, while the bolt was on its way, her body betrayed
      her once again, and she threw up her good hand into the devil horns
      gesture that she knew had been supposed to turn the evil eye, and
      watched the attack break against that defence.</p>

    <p>&#8220;That cannot succeed. Eventually your arm will tire, and you
      will be too sluggish to block my attack. You will soon&#8230;&#8221;</p>

    <p>The voice halted:, suddenly, in the midst of its boast, and a
      deep stillness came across the hill. The figure in flame seemed to
      be distracted by some event behind where Nancy lay sprawled and off
      to her left. She turned to see what it was and saw the moon all
      sliver, without a hint of maria, rise from the clouds. Without
      rhyme or reason, that sight brought reassurance to her and&#8230;
      No pain. She looked at her hand and saw that it was healed without
      scar. As, in retrospect, had she healed once before, under the
      light of the rings of her home world, Wyvern.</p>

    <p>&#8220;The moon may be with you, Priestess, but will not save
      you.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Time will tell, Fire-holder.&#8221;</p>

    <p>The demon did not speak in reply. It had grown silently, and now
      released the gathered fire at Nancy, who spread her arms wide as if
      to greet the attack. Golden flame lapped about her as it struck,
      instantly to be engulfed in blue; and while it jolted her, the jolt
      was more than merely physical, carrying her in a flare of ecstasy
      into the altered state of awareness that she had known once
      before.</p>

    <p>She was now fully herself, though engulfed in the blue flame of
      the gem, and yet more than herself. She felt with the plants and
      animals of the region, could taste the night wind, and touch the
      patterns of its motion. She moulded the fire now, sending a
      streamer out to meet the onrushing lance of red-gold that had been
      launched at her, and dissipated it. She prepared a counter-blow and
      held it ready to launch when the idea struck her that there might
      be more than this one use to the flame she possessed.</p>

    <p>Gently, she released the stored power, letting it strengthen the
      veil about her, and then drew that veil into herself. There was
      another transition, a moment's eddying of darkness, before she
      stood again on the hill, her fire gone out. Equally, she knew that
      she had lost nothing of the flame state, and had possibly gained.
      Not so her enemy, for she heard a contemptuous laugh as another
      vortex of fire rushed towards her. With equal if silent contempt,
      she caught it in her hand, a hand, she noticed with quiet interest,
      that was gloved in silver, and crushed the golden glow. The demon
      form hesitated, and then ran. Nancy would have run after the
      creature, reversing the pursuit that had led them here, had it not
      been that her newly refined senses hinted of a better way.</p>

    <p>She had, even in the flame phase, been able to feel the stresses
      of the air. Now, she reached out, altering their patterns to her
      own will, guiding them about herself until she could fly. A hop, a
      step, and she was carried aloft upon the winds, clumsily at first,
      and then with mounting confidence, as she soared to what she judged
      as fifty feet of altitude, stooping before beginning a long slow
      plunge towards her demon quarry. In her hands of silver, she
      gathered the lighting, like a fluorescent jelly that dripped slowly
      away from an over-full grasp, and released its power at the fleeing
      figure. It howled, but did not drop and staggered into the safety
      of the trees.</p>

    <p>Harshly, Nancy pulled out of the dive, climbing nearly
      vertically to lift herself above trees and pylons for another
      attack run, the next time a target would present itself. Her mind
      reached out to track that hellfire mentality, touched it, and felt
      it go out. There was no barrier, just emptiness. Wary lest this be
      some elaborate trap, she let herself descend gently, and almost to
      the ground and went into the trees afoot, albeit with six inches
      separating her silver shod feet from the soil. She lit her way with
      lightning-bright flashes that seared the retina, and lit the wood
      like day, yet found no-one, and despite her straining for it, there
      was no sign of the demon mind that had pursued her, fought her, and
      vanished from her grasp.</p>

    <p>She gave up the search, after what she guessed had been half an
      hour, and soared out of the oppressive woods, descending to earth
      just outside the city. Though it irked her, she decided to walk
      henceforth, for flight, unlike the new attire she had acquired,
      would attract remark. Yet in the end, her indecent haste in wishing
      to walk about half as fast again as the main flow of people
      attracted its own share of attention from those offended by her
      ungracious passage. Yet what reason was there to hurry, without a
      destination? That sudden quiet thought stopped her as she stood,
      dissipating the frustration that had driven her, and in her pause
      for thought, she realized that at some time past she had lost the
      fleeting calm that the gem induced, was again reduced. She accepted
      the fact resignedly, and dismissed it. All she could do now was
      find a bed for the night.</p>

    <p>Her hand went to her pocket, and touched only bare flesh,
      diverting her attention from the location of her credit card to the
      clothes she now. wore. Silver were her boots, with blocky soles,
      form-fitting: to mid calf, and silver too her gloves, which were
      fine enough to show her fingerprints, and fitted like a second skin
      halfway up her forearms. In contrast, the skin-tight suit covering
      her torso was deepest blue, silver-marred only at the throat, where
      the gem was set in the tight collar, and at the waist, where a
      silver sash broke the uniform field of colour. And were her arms
      and legs not bare, Nancy realized, she would have called this
      outfit a spacesuit. There was also a second and more serious
      deficiency. No pockets, and as consequently, no credit card, no
      locker key. She swore under her breath This was going to cause
      hassle.</p>

    <hr />

    <p>It did. In fact it took half an hour for the public service
      network to research her finances and associated data, delete the
      old card and issue the new one, and now, ten minutes later, sleep
      seemed very attractive indeed. She closed the hotel room door
      behind her, and headed for the bed. The gloves and boots she
      discarded easily, leaving them shrunken on the floor, and then,
      after a few minutes struggle to locate its fastening, her leotard
      joined them, while Nancy settled down to the warm invitation of
      slumber.</p>

    <p>And yet, as she lay there, gazing at the puddle of moonlight on
      the floor, her mind remained awake and active. Things had happened
      to her this as day like had not happened to her, to anyone, things
      that seemed only to have come into existence for the day, without
      proper context in the enduring scheme of things, without even a
      self-consistent logic of their own. And all were focused about the
      entity that had fought her, and then gone away, without the merest
      trace, when the tables had turned. Teleport? All the physics she
      knew denied the possibility so deep in a gravity well. Illusion ?
      if so, one more subtle than her mental defences could block</p>

    <p>Incoherence, and then sleep, claimed her thoughts before she
      could rationalize everything away. Her dreams were full of flight,
      soaring in the interstellar emptiness, or down the corridors of
      non-existent wings of the Castle that had been her home.</p>

    <hr />

    <p>Morning came, bright and clear, with sunlight streaming through
      the open window onto Nancy's bed. She fought to remain asleep
      despite the hurtful glare in her eyes, tossing and turning as she
      transposed fitfully between wakefulness an dream until sleep
      finally abandoned her. She lay a long while as the sluggishness
      left her limbs and she felt ready to stir.</p>

    <p>She pulled on her minimal attire, the wrinkled shrivelled
      material of it seeming to acquire new life as it stretched to fit.
      Clothes would be a definite priority for the day's activity. After
      breakfast.</p>

    <p>Whatever had happened to her body on the previous evening and
      during the night had taken lot more out of her than she had
      realized at the time, goading her to a sickening hunger that
      hastened her steps to the restaurant.</p>

    <p>At this time of the mid-morning, the restaurant was remodelled
      as bar, open to the patio, a swimming pool, and a large lawn.
      Everything was a bright white, and the air was pleasingly cool.
      More important, now there were few other people eating and thus
      less delay likely for her own meal. She would begin, she decided,
      with a large mug of chocolate, and a stack of pancakes in syrup,
      and work on from there when the time came to make further
      decisions, but not before.</p>

    <p>In due course, the meal arrived, and she drank deeply of the
      chocolate, before greedily attacking the stack. Even as she ate,
      the appeasing of her hunger, was noticeable, and as its
      all-pervasive influence declined, another element of disquiet
      became distinguishable. There was a presence about the area that
      compelled her attention.</p>

    <p>Nancy looked up from her plate, eyes, as well as more subtle
      devices, attuned to the task, seeking its cause &#8212; and finding it.
      The psychic unrest that had attracted her attention seemed to
      centre about a young woman, with dusky skin and blonde hair,
      towelling herself down at the poolside. Their eyes met, and held as
      some discharge of psychic effect passed between them, and was
      gone.</p>

    <p>Impulsively, without a clear idea of her intent, Nancy beckoned
      the woman to her table. She in her turn hesitated, as if to make
      sure that it was not some other who was being summoned, and,
      wrapping her towel around herself for warmth, followed the
      invitation.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Hi,&#8221; she said as she sat down on the chair next to Nancy's,
      &#8220;I'm Bree, Bree Tamberlane. Which one of us did whatever
      happened?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Nancy Wolf &#8212; Clan Wolf. I don't think it was me, at least
      not consciously. Are you psychic? I can telepath a little.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I'm a weak sensitive, not enough for the Guild to be
      interested. Are you Guild?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;No, I'm still a free agent, making my way slowly Earthwards.
      You local?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;No, I'm just wandering too. But,&#8221; A troubled frown passed
      across her face, as if she were uncertain whether to continue the
      sentence she had begun.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; Nancy asked in encouragement.</p>

    <p>&#8220;No, I was just wondering what it might be that brought both of
      us here, thousands of miles from the spaceport, from halfway across
      the Partnership. It was as if somehow we were <em>meant</em> to
      meet.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Meant?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Well, not predestination on any rubbish like that, but some
      kind of affinity between us, though what, or how&#8230;?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;You wouldn't happen to be a depressive self exile?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;No, I go in for memory lapses myself.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;You realize,&#8221; Nancy said, in an effort to change the
      direction of the conversation, &#8220;that we're both being amazingly
      frank about ourselves.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;It must be that affinity, whatever happened when I saw you. Are
      you alone here?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Until now. It's that in a way that which brought me here. I was
      thinking of dying here, only self preservation won.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Wow. How were you going to do it?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Fire,&#8221; she half-lied, caught off-guard, without a cover
      story ready.</p>

    <p>Bree's expression as uncertain, as if she wanted to continue the
      conversation but could not find the lines she wanted. Silence
      continued long enough for Nancy to take advantage of the break and
      cut herself another mouthful of pancake.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Where are you staying?&#8221; Bree asked after a minute or so.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Room 609. You?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;420. I'll go and change now. See you around. Bye, Nancy.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;Bye, Bree.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Nancy watched her as she went, uncertain of the decisions she
      had made, each time she had chosen to be open and truthful, laying
      herself open to emotional harm from this woman she did not know.
      And when Bree was gone from her sight, Nancy stood up, abandoning
      the cold remains of her meal, and walked out into the city, out
      among the crowds.</p>

    <hr />

    <p>She window-shopped for half an hour, intent more on putting
      distance between herself and the hotel than on actually buying.
      Eventually, she did stop to buy a few outfits, most of which she
      had delivered to her room, except for a long green dress and white
      blouse an a wide-brimmed hat, all of which she wore directly over
      the outfit she already wore, and in her shoulder-bag she carried a
      respectable handgun for the sense of security it gave to her.</p>

    <p>She lunched in a street caf&eacute;, on a none too imaginative
      choice of ethnic cuisine, and a tall glass of lager, and watched
      the sunlight sparkling from the waters of a fountain in its pool in
      the little rock-garden in the middle of the small square.
      Consciously she tried to act the part of a tourist, to keep her
      mind from stagnating in negative thinking about everything that had
      happened since she had arrived in the system. She half minded to
      leave, unable to think of reason why not, until she decided that
      events had not been resolved, so all her original reasoning still
      held.</p>

    <p>Yet she had done all that there was to do and, still did not
      want to return to the hotel, to face her chance acquaintance. She
      walked restlessly after leaving the restaurant, trying to lose
      herself in the mess of people, and failing. That left her, she
      reluctantly concluded, only one place to go. Out to visit the site
      of last night's conflict, maybe to find something that could
      help&#8230; well, just to satisfy my curiosity, she thought in
      correction.</p>

    <hr />

    <p>In daylight the scene was changed. For one thing, she was not
      alone. The open land down to the river was crowded as any park, and
      their stares seemed hostile and intrusive to Nancy as she walked
      past them, trying to ignore their presence.</p>

    <p>Beneath the trees, however, she felt safe, the moist green
      shadows enclosing her protectively. She slacked her pace for a
      while, until impatience hurried her on. Sunlight dappled the
      grey-brown mould that scattered in dry clods underfoot, making it
      warm, a comforting warmth that she could feel through the soles of
      her boots. The seclusion made it almost seductive, tempting her to
      roll naked on the good earth.</p>

    <p>The river when she came to it, flowing leisurely, peacefully
      along, its waters clear, and bright in the sunlight, offered her
      much the same temptation, to be herself, free from any of the
      restraints that convention placed upon her spirit. With the same
      regrets, she withstood its allure, sad, even annoyed at herself for
      letting her overactive fear of attack and dislike of getting cold
      in the river dissuade her. What right had such mundane matters to
      intrude in situation owing more to poetry?</p>

    <p>The bridge was close now, and as she set foot upon it, she
      finally fought down the call of the wild, and strode along
      purposefully, without turning her head. Beside, she was now almost
      at her intended destination, too close to be distracted.</p>

    <p>At the edge of the trees, she paused, and listened, with ears
      and mind alike. People, random sounds of talk, which, half-noticed,
      had prompted her to actively listen. She moved out of the cover,
      and saw them, a small group in a huddle among the standing stones
      at the hill-top. They were tourists, being given a guided tour of
      the local oddities, and one of the minds had a familiar feel.
      Instantly, on that touch, Nancy clamped her mind shut. Bree had
      been among that group, and she did not know how to react to the
      girl. She faded back into the trees, and followed the edge of them
      around the hill, and waited, and watched.</p>

    <p>After a time that she could place no value in minutes or seconds
      to, the party finally moved on, down the flank of the hill furthest
      from the city, and almost directly towards her. For her part, Nancy
      retreated into the trees, retracing her steps, and every so often,
      checking the progress of the tourists. It seemed that they intended
      to follow the line of pylons a way. Maybe there was some other site
      of relics along that way. She would see later, when the sightseers
      had moved on.</p>

    <p>When at last she deemed the group to be suitably far away, about
      two hundred meters along the line, halfway to where a spur of trees
      cut the line, Nancy left the cover of the trees for the open land,
      heading directly up the hill. A stagefright feeling gripped her as
      she walked, as if eyes were trained upon her from every
      concealment, watching her, just watching.</p>

    <p>She crossed the dry stone wall at the base of the blasted tree
      she had seen the previous night, clutching at its white, dry wood
      for support as she passed. No figure of flame rose this time to bar
      her way, and she crossed the last twenty meters to the stones.</p>

    <p>Gently she reached out one hand to touch the nearest, a rough
      near-cylinder, ten centimetres through, and about two hundred fifty
      tall, its tip looking like it had once been twice as tall and had
      snapped in the middle and its texture was a dull dusty white,
      yet&#8230;</p>

    <p>As her hand drew close blue fire awoke about the silver glove
      she wore and an answering fire woke in the pillar, its dusty white
      woken to clear crystal. Her skin crawled, under the glove first,
      then up the arm, up the side of her head and across her body.</p>

    <p>This intrigued her, so carefully she withdrew her hand the
      thrilling subsided, as did the flame, leaving the sleeve of her
      blouse eaten away up to her elbow. The pillar glowed for a little
      longer before the fire faded.</p>

    <p>She took off her new-bought clothes, packing them into her
      shoulder-bag, and stood once more before the pillar, her feet
      planted solidly on the slight incline, and took the stone between
      her two hands. Blue flame engulfed her poured up the pillar and
      struck across the gap to the adjacent pillars, until the whole
      complex was alight. Her mind readjusted itself into the more
      tightly integrated mode that the gem had before induced, and her
      thoughts were filled with something that wasn't a map but served as
      one. It sparkled with yellow points that she knew were people,
      civilians and one point that burned red. Enemy, her instinct
      insisted.</p>

    <p>The flame burned out with a thunderclap and she stood alone with
      a cold. hate in her mind</p>

    <p>&#8220;No!&#8221; she yelled, trying to deny its alien insistence. But
      she was outvoted, two to one. Both the installation, and the memories
      that had come with the jewel at her throat insisted the necessity
      and the right of the hate she felt for the devil enemy.</p>

    <p>&#8220;No!&#8221; quieter this time, barely voiced, a blunt denial of
      something that revealed itself as external to her, that seemed to
      need her acceptance, her volition, to move. And using her override,
      she channelled the aggression she felt into raw power, and raising
      her arms to the heavens, poured it out in a gout of blue fire that
      dissipated harmlessly.</p>

    <p>She felt weaker after that, but the other thoughts were still.
      However, the map was still clear in her memory, and something that
      was an enemy to the faction of Elder Gods among whom she had thrown
      her lot, might bear investigation, in regard to last night. The
      hate she did not need, it did not suit her temperament, but enemies
      and attempts to murder by pseudo-magical means did tend to have
      some connection.</p>

    <p>A fragment of stone was cruel under her left foot, and she bent
      down to look at it, and saw that she was naked save for the amulet
      on a chain about her neck. Well, thrice could be the charm. She
      embraced the warm stone again, and fire struck from it, engulfing
      her in a gauzy layer of azure and indigo. Left foot. She
      concentrated her attention on the flame, and it gathered to her
      will, and knitted into a silver boot. Right foot this time. A
      gathering, a coalescence, a boot upon the foot. Glove now, and at
      the thought it appeared, and then&#8230; the thought could not be
      framed before the transition was complete.</p>

    <p>Now she had been shown the way, she knew how to handle the
      transition, as a minute's practise showed, taking the change from
      gem to uniform, and back at will. She would have to put that
      together with the lessons she had learned under fire the night
      before, and the device she had encountered as some kind of votive
      talisman gathering dust under museum glass would be fully revealed
      as a combat weapon of undetermined, but probably extremely great,
      capabilities, something distributed to primitives by gun-runners
      among the Elder Gods</p>

    <p>And she had nigh worshipped the selfsame thing, albeit at the
      behest of the memories burned deeply into it by the generations of
      ignorant owners. In her mind she saluted the broken-down
      installation, and then with the cold fire about her, she turned
      away, her thoughts overrun by her adjusting to her new realization
      of her situation.</p>

    <p>So enwrapt was she in her thoughts, that she took little heed of
      the direction in which her feet were taking her, more concerned
      with what to do about the murder machine she had become part of,
      restraining the reckless temptation to take apart everything to the
      horizon for practise. For all its vast power, she would, have to
      regard the device as no different to the gun she carried in her
      shoulder-bag.</p>

    <p>And when she surfaced a while later, to look consciously at the
      world again, it took more than, a few seconds to figure out where
      she was, that she was following the line of pylons in the direction
      that the guided party had taken, and the same direction in which
      she had been advised that one of the enemy still remained. Two
      opposed installations, so close?</p>

    <p>She walked on, curiosity winning over her frantic self-analysis.
      She crossed through the row of trees that at a distance had looked
      much denser than they now seemed, and saw that they marked the end
      of the pylons, and through the trees she saw why. The darkness she
      had taken at distance to be the shadow of a deeper mass of woods
      was revealed as a square of totally black substance that felt
      glassy when she reached down to test its inscrutable surface. There
      was something disturbing about it, though what caused the feeling,
      and which of her triune selves had triggered the alarm were not
      clear. What was clear was that indeed it was the enemy, and
      possibly their equivalent of the stone circle.</p>

    <p>Respectfully, she backed away, senses extended, waiting lest her
      presence had been revealed to that which hunted her. Assured that
      there was no-one in sight, no sign of the unmistakable though
      pattern of her pursuer, Nancy gathered the flame closely about her
      body, and, risking the overt use of the combat-suit's power, took
      to the air, skimming close to the ground, barely a meter above the
      dry earth, at all the speed she dared, until she had regained the
      shelter of her own base. There, she deliberately collapsed the
      flame into the gem, and retired into the cover of the trees.</p>

    <p>From there, she went on foot, but as fast she she could, and.
      now, though naked &#8212; she had no wish to burn away the only clothes
      she had with her should she come under attack &#8212; she found it
      trivially easy to ignore the lure of nature. Only at the far eaves
      of the wood did she pause to put on the long green dress, and hat,
      leaving the seared blouse in the shoulder-bag, along with the
      redundant gun she carried. From now on would be almost safe; she
      would be among people and to some degree hidden.</p>

    <hr />

    <p>Bree was in the front lounge as Nancy returned to the hotel, and
      greeted her like a long-lost friend, hugging her tight, and kissing
      her on the cheek. Nancy tried to shrink away fearing what might
      develop into a compromising situation, glad when at last she was
      freed from temptation as she was released. She was about to explain
      the situation to Bree when the girl suddenly went blank faced, and
      started to collapse. Nancy caught her as she fell, and drove a
      probe into her mind. And found nothing &#8212; not an absence of
      abnormality, but a total absence of all function on any of the few
      surface levels she could reach in such manner. Then, still
      mind-blank, she gained animation, wriggling her way from Nancy's
      hold, and walking towards the elevator. Nancy followed her, and in
      the privacy of the elevator cell blasted her with the stunner she
      carried, and when it stopped at Bree's floor, sent it on to her
      own, where she dragged the inert body into her room, and lay her on
      the bad.</p>

    <p>She took a beer from the fridge, and drank it slowly, while she
      waited for Bree to recover from what had come over her, and from
      the stunner.</p>

    <hr />

    <p>It was an hour later when Bree finally struggled back to
      awareness, after another stun shot to keep her under after first
      awakening in the same robotic state. To pass the time, Nancy had in
      the meanwhile bathed, and changed into another outfit, a heavy blue
      shirt and blue-jeans, and a pair of white leather boots. From there
      she had gone on to grooming her hair, and with nothing else to
      attend to about her person, had returned to the watch.</p>

    <p>Well, actually that was what she called it; in point of fact she
      spent as much time staring out of the window as watching Bree, and
      so missed her actual awakening</p>

    <p>&#8220;What happened?&#8221; Bree managed to ask that question first.</p>

    <p>&#8220;You switched off all your mind, and then started walking away.
      I followed you into the elevator and gave you a quick burst of
      this.&#8221; She held up the gun.</p>

    <p>&#8220;One of my attacks. I get them every so often &#8212; usually end
      up a hundred lites away from where I went under. I had one earlier this
      afternoon, I'm told, only that time I just went berserk and it took
      a couple of Hrulgani to restrain me and I'd only just snapped out
      of it before the group got back to the hotel.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Group?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Guided tour of some Q'l-hrui remnants. We'd gotten to a place
      where there was; a big black slab just set in the ground, and then
      something went off in my head. You seen the local relics?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Yeah, I walked round there earlier. What happened this time
      round?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;You'd just backed away from me, and then for no reason I can
      discern, everything went red. Yeah&#8230; you certainly looked
      worried for some reason. I just didn't notice anything else &#8212; I was
      just looking for a shoulder to cry on after what had just
      happened.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;It felt like you were coming on seriously at me. I wouldn't
      mind that, but I'm not sure that that was what you were
      meaning.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Oh. I'm sorry &#8212; I'm glad that came up right now before I
      could do anything else stupid. That wasn't what I was meaning, I'm
      sorry.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;No, that's all right. I've had too many other things to think
      about than lust for you.&#8221; However, it had been a long enough time
      since she had held another person. If only Trish were here with
      her, if only they could be once again as close in spirit as once
      they had been, before all this. She thought of writing to her
      cousin, asking her to join her, but dismissed the idea at once.
      Their unity had been broken the night she had acquired the killer
      thing that hung cold against her breast, and could never be
      reforged. That wound was still raw, worsened, if anything, by her
      brief involvement just a few days earlier. She did not dare admit
      to herself the secret hope that he had held that Bree and her
      'affinity' would fill that gap, and now.</p>

    <p>She looked wearily at Bree, who for her part was staring
      disinterestedly out of the window. Conversation had died, and she
      could think of no gambit to resurrect it, and time yawned emptily
      for the next three hours until dinner.</p>

    <p>She felt suffocated again, as she had done in her time aboard
      ship, and until Bree seemed ready to depart, convention tied her
      here, denied the solace of restless wandering. It was a time that
      was designed for sleep, but she was wide awake.</p>

    <p>At last, after maybe ten minutes, spent mainly in keeping her
      eyes off Bree, and trying not to brood on her own boredom, she
      finally asked, &#8220;Have you any ideas of what better things we could
      be doing?&#8221;</p>

    <p>A pause, presumably for readjustment to the here and now.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Not really. I can only think of getting something to read, or
      watching the Tree-V or&#8230;&#8221;</p>

    <p><em>You</em>, Nancy thought to herself, supplying the word she
      wanted to complete the sentence</p>

    <p>&#8220;&#8230;listening to some music, perhaps?&#8221; Bree concluded
      after her brief hesitation.</p>

    <p>So much for idle curiosity, Nancy thought. Well, she'd just have
      to live with that. Bree wouldn't be tempted. At least she had
      supplied some excuse to get out and away from each other.</p>

    <p><tt>The fragment ends here</tt></p>

    <hr class="bar" />

    <h2>Afterword (2025)</h2>

    <p>This is the story as it was abandoned, apart from updating the names; the
      plane was called Angharad, the priestess was originally called Linna, and
      the woman Nancy meets was called Suzi Bergman.</p>

    <h2 id="whatever">Afterword (c. 2003) : Whatever happened to Nancy Wolf?
    </h2>

    <p>At this point I stopped writing, because the damned gem was
      taking over, and she was becoming more a Jean Grey as Phoenix than
      the original Telzey Matuchek character I had intended.</p>

    <h3>How the story would have finished</h3>

    <p>Bree is, of course, being piloted by the opposing gem. Cue some
      more Andre Norton style Forerunner bits, an obligatory fight scene,
      and Nancy triumphant, a full time super-heroine. Does this develop
      the character? No.</p>

    <p>If I were to try and finish this today, the story would have to
      end with some form of renunciation of the gem, now revealed as some
      Transcendent-tech enabler (rather than being a Power itself, it
      helps bootstrap a human-level being, as well as having some nifty
      abilities). That would move the character on in some degree.</p>

    <p>Bree/Suzi &#8212; well she ruled herself out as Nancy's life-mate; but I
      think she survives, albeit traumatized, and not entirely certain of
      what happened. She can recover her life and vanishes from the
      tale.</p>
