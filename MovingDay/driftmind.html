    <p>Morning. At last. Those words were not
      spoken, nor even framed as thoughts. They were just a feeling that
      ought to have been relief, but didn't quite achieve the goal.</p>
    <p>Nancy awoke instantly from a feverish sleep, stared dully at the
      ceiling. She felt dull-headed, unclean with dried sweat, and her
      stomach felt raw. Sleep had not refreshed her, and she was too
      leaden limbed to get up and attend to her discomforts.</p>
    <p>She reflected on the course of events that had brought her to
      this sorry state. Six weeks earlier &#8212; such short time &#8212; she had
      been ripped from the quiet routine of her life, and had had her mind
      worked over by a relic of ancient intelligence, and a subversive
      group dedicated to the dispersal of her clan. Unable to fit back in
      her old life, she had tried to make a clean break, start a new life
      that was a continuation of the old, just displaced, footloose and
      fancy free.</p>
    <p>Now she could see how forlorn that hope had been. She was in many
      senses a different person now. The combined assault on her mind had
      done more than awaken some unforeseen telepathic potentials. They
      had, incidentally, uncaringly, ruptured some brittle structures in
      her mind. Darknesses, once hidden beyond her own knowledge now
      seeped through to the surface.</p>
    <p>What periods of happiness she had enjoyed seemed to be briefer,
      shallower than before. Even the excitement of exploring her new
      senses had been marred by the intervention of a malignant mentality
      wishing to possess her, to itself become Nancy Wolf. She had in a
      sense died, albeit briefly, under its attack, and yet had regained
      herself. That had been ten days before, and in that time she had
      more than once found herself regretting that &#8216;happy' ending.
    </p>
    <p>Last night had been one such time, and she had used a party to
      which she had been invited as an excuse to drown her sorrows in
      drink. The attempt had failed miserably, with the drink and the
      happiness of the other revellers turning her thoughts inwards, and
      though the memories had been blurred in the recording she recalled
      long and detailed expositions of her personal woes that she had
      recounted to perfect strangers, until finally, puking and raving,
      she had been escorted to bed by the girl with whom she had been
      partnered.</p>
    <p>And now, she must face the morning after. She cast away the one
      sheet that remained on her bed, and staggered to her feet, pausing
      for a few vertiginous instants as her circulation adapted itself to
      her new posture, before discarding the underwear in which she had
      slept, and heading for the bathroom. A hot bath would take care of
      most of her discomforts, and there would doubtless be something in
      the medical supplies that would be appropriate for her stomach.</p>
    <p>Between the tasteless slurry that had been dispensed for her
      stomach, and the relaxing warmth of the bath, Nancy drowsed,
      catching up on the sleep she had lost, only to be jolted from the
      tranquillity of non-thought by the door-buzzer. She fought petty
      anger at the person responsible, but failed to stem its evil tide,
      and with a hate in her heart that the mask of her expression only
      concealed, she went to answer he call.</p>
    <p>The tall avian steward waiting at the door did not react visibly
      to the towel-wrapped, dripping figure that answered</p>
    <p>&#8220;Lady Wolf?&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; Coldly, Nancy noticed how she filled that word with
      hate and spat it out.</p>
    <p>&#8220;A package for you. Sign here.&#8221;</p>
    <p>Anger gave way to curiosity, and it was excitement that spread
      her signature untidily across the form.</p>
    <p>&#8220;Thanks,&#8221; she called, distractedly, as she shut the door
      again.</p>
    <p>Asprawl on her bed, she examined the package, a small box, four
      inches by five, and three quarters of an inch deep. The address
      label was printed, and postmarked from the next system Earthwards of
      the current position of this liner. Nancy could think of no one she
      knew or had ever known who could have sent something to her from
      there.</p>
    <p>She cut the seal open with her thumbnail, and scattered the
      contents out onto the sheets. Freed from its wad of packaging, a
      small pendant glittered there, a square of bright metal set with a
      pale-blue transparent gem. Disbelieving, Nancy looked to her bedside
      table where the original lay, its gem indigo, not cornflower blue.
      She sought explanation from the small envelope which had remained in
      the box. It contained a note handwritten on a sheet of cream toned
      paper.</p>
    <p>'If you know this, then your time is come. I may have been
      delayed a few million years, but now, I have you.'</p>
    <p>In place of signature there were three whorls of glowing red
      light, like fingerprints woven into the page.</p>
    <p>Before reading, Nancy had been sliding into mild hysterical
      shock, while she wove in this seemingly impossible gift. Now she was
      only afraid. For the last few weeks, she had been able to set aside,
      regard as but an echo, an engram that shaped the energies within the
      gem, that personality that had woken into her. Memories that were
      not truly hers, that had been planted by the indigo gem, stirred to
      life, memories of the previous owner, Vaelithra, High Priestess of
      the Earth, worshipper of light and life, the gem her badge of
      office, and she had known that sign of three.</p>
    <p>The powers of Sky and Earth had not been alone in bestowing aid
      to their faithful: and the spirits of Fire and Night had matched the
      powers of life in their generosity, and in the teachings of both
      cults there was the prophecy that at the end of time, the two
      factions would rise in open combat, and bring down the curtain. Was
      this to be that battle, her own self against the person or persons
      who now controlled the opposing holy relics?</p>
    <p>Armageddon, universal ruin across the cosmos full of galaxies
      unaffected by the original struggle, Nancy could not accept, but her
      own death seemed all too likely. Would she run? She might be able
      to, depending on the sequencing of the Links, but if she had been
      located, it would not be easy &#8212; if indeed it were possible &#8212; to
      shake off pursuit, and to be condemned to eternal flight. She would
      rather die than suffer that tyranny.</p>
    <p>There was only one alternative, to stand and fight, and her one
      advantage, that she would be able to choose where. Ship-board,
      obviously, was far too fragile an environment for any display of
      force, such as she could recall from Vaelithra's memory. The only
      suitable place would be dirtside, on the green Earth, where her own
      power would be the stronger.</p>
    <p>&#8220;Ship,&#8221; she called, &#8220;This is Nancy Wolf, Cabin 06&#8211;458.
      I'm pausing my journey here. Have my luggage stowed on board the
      Link station.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;Decision registered. Your luggage will be collected in ten
      minutes. Thank you for your custom.&#8221;</p>
    <p>Packing was trivial. One suitcase was filled from her wardrobe,
      the other from the incidental luggage scattered around the cabin.
      All the remaining trash and trinkets were dumped in the bin, and
      that was all. The bath, the half destroyed bed, were all the trace
      she would leave of her passing.</p>
    <p>One last check, one final decision on what to wear, and she
      departed. She travelled light, with only a shoulder-bag to carry her
      minimum of supplies. Anything else, she had money enough to buy.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>By the time the shuttle undocked from the link, half an hour
      later, Nancy had a clearer idea of what she would do. Time was her
      most precious resource, her two hour lead over any opponent fighting
      the timetables down the line from the next system, two hours that
      would remain hers until she stopped. Meanwhile, she would ignore the
      oh-so-familiar sight of the link station drifting away into the
      distance, and concentrate on the guidebook she had purchased, in
      case there might be some useful peculiarity of the world, something
      that would work to her advantage.</p>
    <p>The world was called Angharad, and it was green and summery
      through its year of barely perceptible seasons. It was a world
      slightly smaller than Earth, roughly half of its surface dry land.
      There was only one spaceport &#8212; the population being too small to
      warrant more. That was the first bonus, that her pursuit would be
      constricted a longer time.</p>
    <p>She continued to read, gleaning other interesting snippets of
      information about the world. It had been tamed long before the first
      Partnership vessel had approached it, and had remained so. Even the
      cities, at that point simply scatters of its own Q'l-hrui ruins,
      had been there then, all placed in the most advantageous regions, on
      fertile plains, away from the deep continental deserts, but linked
      with an encompassing grid of rail tracks.
    </p>
    <p>The presence of the ruins bothered her, as if she might have
      ceded her advantage by stopping on this deliberately bucolic and
      sleepy world, with who knows what ancient forces slumbering. But,
      too late, the die was cast.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>The landing field was a seemingly endless expanse of concrete,
      uncomfortably bright in the bright sunlight. The sky a little too
      dark by Nancy's prejudices, the clouds too wispy, and the gravity
      perceptibly lighter than the shipboard value. Planets seemed a
      little primitive after only weeks away, despite her atavistic desire
      for a blue sky and bright sun overhead.</p>
    <p>She shrugged, more with her face than her shoulders, and followed
      the other passengers into the reception hall, a bright white
      construction of corrugated metal where a few officials waited to
      supervise the newcomers. Nancy chose a queue randomly &#8212; there was
      none perceptibly shorter than any other &#8212; and resigned herself to
      the wait.</p>
    <p>The formalities were thankfully brief, and soon she was at the
      head of the queue. The rodent-like creature at the desk sounded
      bored as he asked to see her passport, and asked for a few other
      bits and pieces of information for the files.</p>
    <p>&#8220;The purpose of your visit?&#8221; he asked.</p>
    <p>&#8220;I'm expecting to meet someone here.&#8221; She had none of her
      usual lies ready against that question, and so answered with almost
      the truth. She was greeted by an expression that clearly thought
      this world an unlikely place for rendezvous.</p>
    <p>&#8220;How long will you be staying?&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;A few days at most. Matters should resolve swiftly after we
      meet, and then, who knows?&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>As soon as she left the hall, she headed directly for a public
      terminal &#8212; she would have to choose a destination. She requested a
      map, and jabbed her finger randomly at it to decide . The resultant
      choice had only its name to distinguish it from any other possible
      choice, so there could be no underlying drive to choose any other &#8212;
      just whatever psychic forces might be influencing her.</p>
    <p>Nancy withdrew her card, and looked around the reception area for
      signposts. She strolled away from her corner, watching for one to
      appear from behind stairways or ornamental greenery, though the
      hall, easily a hundred yards long, encouraged her to patience: if
      she could not see a sign now, there was plenty of opportunity for
      one later.</p>
    <p>She paused at one of the shops that lined the hall, and bought
      things to read during the journey, bundling them into her
      shoulder-bag, then moving on to a snack bar, where she bought a
      basic breakfast. She ate as she walked, following the sign that she
      now could see in the distance, directing her to the rail terminal,
      up a flight of stairs to the catwalk level. She discarded her now
      empty cup as she climbed, letting it drift into a trash-can below.</p>
    <p>There was another receptacle by the ticket machine, where she
      deposited the napkin which had wrapped the rest of the meal, and
      wiped her hands, before tapping the key labelled Halcyon. The
      plastic tab that would permit her the random journey clattered into
      the receiving dish. She picked it up, hesitantly, as if that could
      delay the inevitable. A travel plan appeared on the dispenser
      screen, giving her a choice between the first departing train, and
      the more direct one that would reach the final destination first.
      She decided upon the second, despite the half hour it would hold her
      at the spaceport. She went through to the waiting area, a scattering
      of chairs and tables, with continuous windows on two sides allowing
      a view out onto the field.</p>
    <p>Nancy had no eyes for the comparatively uninspiring aspect, nor
      did she notice the bar, just the clock above it. She sat herself
      down where she could just look up to see the time, and began to read
      one of the books she had bought.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Once aboard the train, however, she had no taste for reading. She
      had never travelled so fast so close to the ground, and the
      increased perception of speed drew her attention. Out of the city,
      the line passed first through forest, and the continuously changing
      aspect of sun, and trees presented a hypnotic display of light.</p>
    <p>The outside air had been cool, but inside the carriage, the
      sunlight was warm. Imperceptibly, Nancy felt her eyes grow heavy,
      beyond her capacity to hold them open.</p>
    <p>Dreams came to her, interwoven with her intermittent glimpses of
      objective reality. And amidst the dreams, there were threads of her
      false memories.</p>
    <p>So when she walked again the woodland path down to river that she
      had known only, yet repeatedly, in her dreams, she was at times not
      herself, but Vaelithra, so that when she turned a bend in the
      river's course, she came across the temple where she had trained.
      There was a sense of the sky darkening as she approached, a threat
      above her. In the distance, behind her, something glowed red, and
      she knew it for the witchfires of the night cult. Nancy forced
      herself into control of the dream, forced herself to levitate, to
      speed her travel, fighting the unaccustomed resistance she met.</p>
    <p>It was all she could to to lift herself a handsbreadth from the
      ground, and half walk, half drift along, but it brought her to the
      temple itself ahead of the threat. She screamed with her mind as she
      raced along the central path, calling for people long departed, the
      fires of devotion cold, their ashes scattered onto the floor</p>
    <p>That shocked the Vaelithra-structure, and Nancy, freed from its
      moulding of her dream ducked out. She stood on the riverbank under
      the sunlight, where it was crossed by a broad belt of grassland,
      between two halves of an old-fashioned city. Two exotic looking
      young women stood nearby, at the door of a small cabin.</p>
    <p>&#8220;Where is the spaceport?&#8221; she asked them.</p>
    <p>&#8220;But this is Halcyon.&#8221; The reply was unnecessary; she knew
      where to go. She struck away from the river, along the highway of
      grass.</p>
    <p>Something startled her awake, and she forced her eyes open. A few
      moments of disorientation went by while she adapted herself to the
      time of day, and realized that the train had reached the first stop
      of three <cite>en route</cite> to Halcyon, and would soon be heading
      out into the wide deserts.</p>
    <p>She ordered a jug of sparkling water to help remove the stale
      taste in her mouth, and a somewhat unimaginative lunch to occupy her
      mind for at least part of the next leg of the journey, and while she
      waited she looked around to see her fellow passengers. They were a
      mixed bunch, none of them human &#8212; an Ayassa female in traditional
      kilt, a troupe of shaggy blue spider-monkeys, a number of huddled
      beings in all concealing robes, and some strange being in a heavily
      armoured environment suit. None seemed likely to strike up a
      conversation; and at that moment, she would have welcomed anything
      to take her mind off the reason for making this trip at all, and to
      prevent her dreaming about it. She had been unable to think of
      anything that she could do for herself, and so she wished now only
      to forget what was going on, pretend that nothing was wrong, at
      least until it happened</p>
    <hr />

    <p>It was evening, now. As she looked out of the window Nancy could
      see at last the city of Halcyon, its white spires gleaming in the
      golden light. The rail track itself formed a jewelled thread,
      reaching out from the city, curving wide around the low hill that
      still hid the mass of the city, and out to her</p>
    <p>She gathered together her belongings and turned, impatiently to
      the window, as if she could hurry her arrival by the force of her
      will, although she knew that it would nearly three hours before her
      pursuer could arrive. There was, as she expected, a hotel catering
      to travellers near the station, and she checked in for a short stay,
      leaving her meagre luggage, still packed, in her room. Now all she
      carried was the key, her credit card, and holstered in her right
      boot the small gun that she carried out of habit.</p>
    <p>She wandered restlessly, waiting out the time with growing
      impatience. Occasionally, she opened the defences about her mind. to
      ease the chafing, for all that it forced her into overly intimate
      contact with the swarms of other minds around, and left her unclean
      as she retreated behind the barriers, but there was never a trace of
      hostility directed at her.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Two hours brought her roughly back to her starting place, having
      traced a path through most of the city. She had decided to have one
      last meal, before&#8230; She realized that even the prospect of imminent
      death did not fill her with the fear that, even a month ago, it
      would have done. But then, she remembered wryly, she had died once
      in that intervening time. She choked back hysterical laughter,
      hanging grimly on to her own version of sanity, and forcing her
      conscious thoughts to the location of a place to eat.</p>
    <p>She chose the first restaurant she came to, its one small dining
      room already crowded, and sat down at a corner table for two,
      slightly apart from the general huddle of diners. Their conversation
      came to her, in isolated snippets, intruding into her consciousness
      while she studied the menu. She felt herself despising the people to
      whom she could attribute the dialogue, for only so acting out
      stereotypes. There was one group who were obviously tourists, a
      couple, obviously a mated pair, having a soap-opera argument and a
      number of persons of a very non-human race gossiping most intensely,
      within arm's reach. No one else seemed to be dining alone. The
      bitterness that now seemed to be her constant companion welled up
      inside her, tearing her apart, when she resisted the temptation to
      tears or anger.</p>
    <p>&#8220;Hi! What'll you be having?&#8221; The arrival of a waiter, a
      casually dressed feline woman, turned her attention outwards again.
      Nancy ordered, her choice made off the top of her head.</p>
    <p>&#8220;Fine. Thanks.&#8221; the girl smiled at her before going off with
      the order. Nancy sighed. That girl had been happy in her hobby, and
      friendly: why could people be so open precisely when she could not
      follow that openness up? Was it because of the intimacy associated
      with the provision of food, or a cynical professional openness,
      possible only because any interaction would be transient? Nancy
      could not choose one answer over the other. Hope chose the former,
      so she denied its choice. She felt a tear form at the corner of her
      right eye, and affected an itch to hide the reason that she tended
      to the eye.</p>
    <p>Was this screen of lies that she hid behind something that
      everyone did? Even cynicism could not answer that. It could only
      remind her of her feeling of her own essential hollowness behind her
      facade, not even knowing if she was truly her own person.</p>
    <p>She didn't even interrupt the train of thought while she faked a
      sorrowful smile for, and accepted her first course from another
      waiter, a human male, who smiled back at her as well. She bore the
      pangs of despair within herself until she was unobserved, and could
      relax her expression. This time her face contorted itself in
      preparation for tears, and, she forced her feelings away, trying to
      return to the good old days before emotional issues arose to
      complicate things, before she had had to feel for herself.</p>
    <p>She sighed, half in regret, half in appreciation of the cold
      tangy taste of her drink, and began to eat greedily, which at least
      beat thinking for entertainment.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Too soon for Nancy's liking, she could eat no more and would once
      again have to face outside reality. She felt mentally tired as she
      went to pay her bill, too tired even to raise a wan smile as she
      did, and she fled as soon as the transaction was complete.</p>
    <p>The darkness on the street, the jazzy lighting, rolled unnoticed
      off her back, Night, as far as her mood would allow her to be
      concerned, was merely an inevitable fact and the city lights were an
      immediate corollary. She knew that her time of reckoning came soon,
      and some impulse decided her to seek out a hidden place beyond the
      city. Later in her wandering, she rationalized her choice as being
      motivated by a desired to protect lives and property but at the
      time, it seemed pure whimsy upon her part.</p>
    <p>This city, a town really, built around small squares,
      organic-seeming towers, and elevated boulevards, ended abruptly;
      beyond the perimeter, only the empty land. Her route had taken her
      south, across the railway, and the final ramp that led her out of
      the city faced south-east. Across to her left, she could see, by the
      lights in it, the last sweep of the line into the city. Turning
      slowly, she saw in the east a faint shimmering of light behind thin
      clouds, and a paling of the sky that foretold the rising of a moon.
      Directly in front of her lay a bare grassy hill, and then past it, a
      swirl of pale mist, and the dark shapes of trees. A river; the only
      interesting terrain in the vicinity. Unhurriedly, she walked in that
      direction. She knew she still had enough lead over her pursuit to
      reach it.</p>
    <p>As she passed, she felt, rather than saw, in the starlight, the
      terrain change underfoot, the grass become longer, heaped into
      irregular mounds: that formed an almost impossible surface to walk,
      before merging into a uniform calf-high blanket on the ground. In
      the growing light before moonrise, and her growing adaptation to the
      dark, she could now see to guide her way past obstacles, fallen,
      blasted trees, now only bleached shells, stripped of leaf and
      branch. and between the main avenue of their yet-living brothers
      along the mist-curdled river. There was a chill dankness to the
      scent of the air, and the utmost calm, yet without the sense of
      impending storm &#8212; ironical in the face of what must surely come to
      pass.</p>
    <p>Between the trees, the earth was bare again, save for the debris
      of the last autumn, and the darkness folded her in its cloak, hiding
      her rather than engulfing. Her arcane senses, loosed as she passed
      beyond the city, detected a thread of a call from ahead, as from a
      welcoming beacon, her Vaelithra memories endorsing the faint
      message. In her flight, she had indeed not been as random as she had
      intended, instead following some unconscious notion of a place of
      possible sanctuary.</p>
    <p>She stared forward into the gloom, to the pale curtain of light
      ahead that was the river. There was no sign of the beckoning place;
      merely the swirls of mist. She hurried forwards to the river, as
      much as the poor seeing allowed, and did not find the crumbling
      earth of a normal riverbank, but a path leading both ways. She
      followed it to her left, and soon ahead a bridge loomed out of the
      mist, a spar of the same not-quite-rock of the path, and she crossed
      it.</p>
    <p>There was a similar path on the far bank, but she spurned it and
      stumbled her way through the trees there, and out into the open,
      spurred on by a feeling of the closeness of her unknown goal. The
      open land came suddenly upon her, and she stopped at the edge of its
      extent. Above her, paralleling the trees, and ultimately the river,
      a line of pylons extended in both directions, as far as she could
      see. Beyond that line, a low hill with a handful of trees on its
      slopes, one standing stark, blasted and dead on the skyline at the
      left, at the contour of some darkness, be it a wall or hedge she
      could not tell. At the summit a number of slender stones were
      arranged in what she guessed was a circle. Pale blue fires played
      around their tips. She now knew what she had been seeking, a safe
      place of the powers allied to Vaelithra's cause. She felt their
      call, and knew that it offered safety for her; and in that same
      instant she felt the hellfire breath of the aura of her pursuer.</p>
    <p>She walked calmly up the hill, knowing that pursuit could not
      catch her before she had gained the summit, and at the darkness, now
      clearly a low wall of dry stone, she turned and looked back to the
      city. A mile away, it did not seem diminished by distance, rather it
      seemed merely to have been given context. It, and the intervening
      terrain, gave no sign of any life, and it did not surprise her that
      she did not see anything. That could wait until she had gained the
      summit.</p>
    <p>Stepping over the wall, barely more than knee-high, was nothing
      significant on the ground; but as she did so, Nancy felt a sense of
      transition, and looked around to find the city obscured, or
      obscurely altered.</p>
    <p>&#8220;Hold!&#8221; Nancy wheeled to find the source of that cry, and
      saw, halfway between herself and the summit, a figure indistinct in
      the darkness, and seemingly wreathed in dull red fire, and felt the
      gem at her breast surge into life. She recalled the first time she
      had worn it, how it had caught her up in triumphal song, never since
      to waken. This was like that time, yet weaker, and she too bound to
      her immediate conception of reality to let herself go.</p>
    <p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221; she called in counter challenge, her voice
      weak in her ears.</p>
    <p>&#8220;My names are many, as well you know, priestess of earth, as
      indeed are yours. They are all irrelevant. Now is our hour.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;I don't suppose you're open to reasonable persuasion?&#8221; Nancy
      felt the weakness of her voice change to tiredness as she made her
      final play. The reply was only laughter, floating on the slightest
      of winds.</p>
    <p>Fire gathered in her challenger's darkness, and roared at her,
      passing unnoticing the blue fire that guarded her, and her clothing
      and her flesh, to strike at her spirit. It broke like a storm
      against her mind's defences, and sent pain lancing through her whole
      existence. She screamed in a scream that tore at her throat, in
      pain, misery and fear.</p>
    <p>When she had come to this place expecting death, it had merely
      been the concept of annihilation that she had accepted; she had
      given no though to the many roads that might lead to that end, and
      how many lead through pain. That was what she could not accept. She
      had to struggle, to fight her way clear; and yet she had no
      resources available. The gem she wore had power but it was not hers
      to command, and the time spent in surrender to it was not left to
      her.</p>
    <p>In a moment of clarity, detached from the swirl of competing
      memories, she reached for the gun she had holstered in her boot to
      counter this opponent &#8211; after all, a stunner blast had stripped
      the influence of the gem from her on the night she had acquired it &#8211;
      but found nothing. These were not even the clothes she had been
      wearing as she climbed the hill.</p>
    <p>It held forth one hand, and the flame gathered about it,
      brightening, and in the instant, leaping forth even as she rolled to
      one side, began a mad scramble to reach the hilltop around where the
      other stood, gathering more of its fires.</p>
    <p>&#8220;Now, it is over. You will soon&#8230;&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>She wanted to call out asking that her death be brief, yet
      remained silent as this next attack was prepared. She yearned for
      it, the brief explosion that would tear her from this agonized shell
      of flesh, and yet, the voice halted, as Nancy stumbled upon a sudden
      mass amongst the tall grasses, sprawling headlong over a slab of
      rock, and into darkness.</p>
    <p>For some moments, she felt herself floating in a void, then, like
      waking from a brief sleep, she was standing on a path that glowed a
      gentle blue, leading up the circle of stones above.</p>
    <p>&#8220;You may have found the path, Priestess, but it will not save
      you.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;Time will tell, Fire-holder.&#8221;</p>
    <p>The demon did not speak in reply. It had grown silently, and now
      released the gathered fire, and she spread her arms wide as if to
      greet the attack. Golden flame lapped about her as it struck,
      instantly to be engulfed in blue; and while it jolted her, the jolt
      was more than merely physical, carrying her in a flare of ecstasy
      into that altered state of awareness that she had known once before,
      as she surrendered to the Vaelithra gem.</p>
    <p>Engulfed in the blue flame of the gem, she was Vaelithra
      awakened, deeply aware of more than just herself. She felt with the
      plants and animals of the region, could taste the night wind, and
      touch the patterns of its motion. She moulded the blue fire now,
      sending a streamer out to meet the onrushing lance of red-gold that
      had been launched at her, and dissipated it. She prepared a
      counter-blow and held it ready to launch when the idea struck her
      that there might be more than this one use to the flame she
      possessed.</p>
    <p>Gently, she released the stored power, letting it strengthen the
      veil about her, and then drew that veil into herself. There was
      another transition, a moment's eddying of darkness, before she stood
      again on the hill, her fire gone out. Equally, she knew that she had
      lost nothing of the flame state, and had possibly gained. Not so her
      enemy, for she heard a contemptuous laugh as another vortex of fire
      rushed towards her. With equal, if silent, contempt, she caught it
      in her hand, a hand, she noticed with quiet interest, that was
      gloved in silver, and crushed the golden glow. The demon form
      hesitated, and then fled. In her hands of silver, she gathered the
      lighting, like a fluorescent jelly that dripped slowly away from an
      over-full grasp, and released its power at the fleeing figure. It
      howled, but did not drop and staggered into the confusion of
      boulders that lay on the far side of the hill from the stone circle.</p>
    <p>She climbed to the stone circle that would give her a commanding
      view of the slope, and conjured such a glow from the stones to light
      the slopes like day, but nothing moved. Letting the light subside,
      she waited and watched for what she guessed had been half an hour,
      until clouds came up and obscured the land. Gradually, the flames of
      the gem subsided, and she felt herself descending to her mundane
      self, leaving the Q'l-hrui dream that had overcome her, ultimately
      weary, drained of energy, ready to slumber.</p>
    <p>No, she told herself, this would not do. She would have to pull
      herself together, trudge down that hill to the brightly lit city
      that lay across the river, and her bed for the night.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Morning came, bright and clear, with sunlight streaming through
      the open curtains onto Nancy's bed. She fought to remain asleep
      despite the hurtful glare in her eyes, tossing and turning as she
      transposed fitfully between wakefulness and dream until sleep
      finally abandoned her. She lay a long while as the sluggishness left
      her limbs and she felt ready to stir, ready to feed. Whatever had
      happened to her body on the previous evening and during the night
      had taken lot more out of her than she had realized at the time, now
      resolving to a hunger that surprised her.</p>
    <p>Quickly, she washed and dressed, once again taking inventory of
      what she carried, that had been restored on her return to what she
      thought of as the waking world, then headed out.</p>
    <p>At this time of the mid-morning, the hotel restaurant was
      remodelled as bar, open to the patio, a swimming pool, and a large
      lawn. Everything was a bright white, and the air was pleasingly cool
      &#8211; and the buffet all well stocked for her to graze while waiting
      for coffee and the cooked meal.</p>
    <p>As she tackled the well heaped plate from the buffet, the
      immediate hunger began to subside, and as its all-pervasive
      influence declined, another element of disquiet became
      distinguishable. There was a presence about the area that compelled
      her attention.</p>
    <p>Nancy looked up from her plate, eyes, as well as more subtle
      senses, attuned to the task, seeking its cause &#8212; and finding it.
      The psychic unrest that had attracted her attention seemed to centre
      about a young woman, with dusky skin and blonde hair, towelling
      herself down at the poolside. Their eyes met, and held as some
      discharge of psychic effect passed between them, and was gone.</p>
    <p>Impulsively, without a clear idea of her intent, Nancy nodded
      assent as the woman indicated coming to join her. She in her turn
      hesitated, as if to make sure that it was not some other who was
      being indicated, and, wrapping her towel around herself for warmth,
      followed the invitation.</p>
    <p>&#8220;Hi,&#8221; she said as she sat down on the chair next to Nancy's,
      &#8220;I'm Bree, <span style="background: transparent">Bree Tamberlane.</span>
      Which one of us did whatever happened?&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;Nancy Wolf &#8212; Clan Wolf. I don't think it was me, at least
      not consciously. Are you psychic? I can telepath a little.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;I'm a weak sensitive, not enough for the Guild to be
      interested. Are you Guild?&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;No, I'm still a free agent, making my way slowly Earthwards.
      You local?&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;No, I'm just wandering too. But,&#8221; A troubled frown passed
      across her face, as if she were uncertain whether to continue the
      sentence she had begun.</p>
    <p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; Nancy asked in encouragement.</p>
    <p>&#8220;No, I was just wondering what it might be that brought both of
      us here, thousands of miles from the spaceport, from halfway across
      the Partnership. It was as if somehow we were <em>meant</em> to
      meet.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;Meant?&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;Well, not predestination on any rubbish like that, but some
      kind of affinity between us, though what, or how&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;You wouldn't happen to be a depressive self exile?&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;No, I go in for memory lapses myself.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;You realize,&#8221; Nancy said, in an effort to change the
      direction of the conversation, &#8220;that we're both being amazingly
      frank about ourselves.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;It must be that ... whatever it was happened when I saw you.
      Are you alone here?&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;Until now. It's that in a way that which brought me here. I
      was thinking I might die here, only self preservation won.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;Wow. What happened, what was it?&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;Wandering off into the night, getting lost. I was just in a
      bad place.&#8221; she half-lied, caught off-guard, without a cover story
      ready.</p>
    <p>Bree's expression as uncertain, as if she wanted to continue the
      conversation but could not find the lines she wanted. Silence
      continued long enough for Nancy to take advantage of the break and
      cut herself another mouthful of pancake.</p>
    <p>&#8220;Where are you staying?&#8221; Bree asked after a minute or so.</p>
    <p>&#8220;Room 609. You?&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;497. I'll go and change now. See you around. Bye, Nancy.&#8221;
    </p>
    <p>&#8220;Bye, Bree.&#8221;</p>
    <p>Nancy watched her as she went, uncertain of the decisions she had
      made, each time she had chosen to be open and truthful, laying
      herself open to emotional harm from this woman she did not even
      know.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>After concluding her substantial breakfast, Nancy set out to lose
      herself amongst the crowds. She window-shopped extensively, intent
      more on putting distance between herself and the hotel than on
      actually buying.
    </p>
    <p>She lunched in a street cafÃ©, on a none too imaginative choice
      of ethnic cuisine, and a tall glass of lager, and watched the
      sunlight sparkling from the waters of a fountain in its pool in the
      little rock-garden in the middle of the small square. Consciously
      she tried to act the part of a tourist, to keep her mind from
      stagnating in negative thinking about everything that had happened
      since she had arrived in the system. She half minded to leave,
      unable to think of reason why not, until she decided that events had
      not been resolved, so all her original reasoning still held.</p>
    <p>Yet she had done all that there was to do and, still did not want
      to return to the hotel, to face her chance acquaintance. She walked
      restlessly after leaving the restaurant, trying to lose herself in
      the mess of people, and failing. That left her, she reluctantly
      concluded, only one place to go. Out to visit the site of last
      night's conflict, maybe to find something that could help&#8230; well,
      just to satisfy my curiosity, she thought in correction.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>In daylight the scene was changed. For one thing, though morning
      sun had given way to light overcast, she was not alone. The open
      land down to the river was scattered with people, like any park
      would be; by no means crowded, but more than enough to make her feel
      alone in a crowd.</p>
    <p>Moving on, beneath the trees, she felt calmer, the moist green
      darkness enclosing her protectively. She slacked her pace for a
      while, until impatience hurried her on. The grey-brown mould that
      scattered in dry clods underfoot radiated a comforting warmth that
      she could feel through the soles of her boots. The seclusion made it
      almost seductive, tempting her to roll naked on the good earth. The
      river when she came to it, flowing leisurely, peacefully along, its
      waters clear, and silvery in the grey light, offered her much the
      same temptation, to be herself, free from any of the restraints that
      convention placed upon her spirit. With the same regrets, she
      withstood its allure, sad, even annoyed at herself for acting so
      subdued.</p>
    <p>The bridge was close now, and as she set foot upon it, she
      finally fought down the call of the wild, and strode along
      purposefully, without turning her head. Beside, she was now almost
      at her intended destination, too close to be distracted.
    </p>
    <p>At the edge of the trees on the far side, she paused, and
      listened, with ears and mind alike. People, random sounds of talk,
      which, half-noticed, had prompted her to actively listen. She moved
      out of the cover, and saw them, a small group among the standing
      stones at the hill-top. Clearly a group being given a guided tour of
      the local oddities, and as she reached out to eavesdrop, one of the
      minds had a familiar feel. Instantly, on that touch, Nancy clamped
      her mind shut. Bree had been among that group, and she did not know
      how to react to the girl. She faded back into the trees, and
      followed the edge of them around the hill, and waited, and watched.</p>
    <p>After a wait that seemed to go on and on, the party finally moved
      on, down the flank of the hill furthest from the city, and almost
      directly towards her. For her part, Nancy retreated into the trees,
      retracing her steps, and every so often, checking the progress of
      the tourists. It seemed that they intended to follow the line of
      pylons for some distance further. Maybe there was some other site of
      relics along that way. She would see later, when the sightseers had
      moved on.</p>
    <p>When at last she deemed the group to be suitably far away, about
      two hundred meters along the line, Nancy left the cover of the trees
      for the open land, heading directly up the hill. A stage-fright
      feeling gripped her as she walked, as if eyes were trained upon her
      from every concealment, watching her, just watching.</p>
    <p>She crossed the dry stone wall at the base of the blasted tree
      she had seen the previous night, clutching at its white, dry wood
      for support as she passed. No sense of stepping into some otherness,
      no figure of flame rising to confront her, this time, and she
      climbed the last twenty meters to the stones.</p>
    <p>Gently she reached out one hand to touch the nearest, a rough
      near-cylinder, a dull dusty white column just wide enough that she
      could comfortably reach her arms around, and maybe thrice her
      height, its tip looking like it had been snapped off, yet&#8230;</p>
    <p>As her hand drew close a faint aura of blue fire awoke upon the
      pillar, turning part of the dusty white woken to clear crystal. The
      skin on her hand crawled, then up the arm, up the side of her head
      and across her whole body. Jerking her hand away, she retreated a
      few steps, and as she did so, the feeling subsided, as did the aura,
      the clear patch of crystal remaining a little longer after the fire
      faded.</p>
    <p>A yearning, an allure, came upon her, to actually embrace the
      pillar, as the Q'l-hrui gem she wore flashed with answering fire.
      Both gem and larger installation seemed insistent that she should
      yield herself to them, her thoughts filling with something that
      wasn't a map but served as one, sparkling with yellow points that
      she knew were minds, civilians and one point that burned red. Enemy,
      they insisted.</p>
    <p>&#8220;No!&#8221; she yelled, trying to deny its alien insistence. But
      she was outvoted, two to one. Both the installation, and the
      memories that had come with the jewel at her throat insisted the
      necessity and the right of the hate she felt for the devil enemy.</p>
    <p>&#8220;No!&#8221; quieter this time, barely voiced, a blunt denial of
      something that revealed itself as external to her, that seemed to
      need her acceptance, her volition, to move. And using that grace,
      she channelled the aggression she felt into a primal howling of
      psychic energies, raging against the heavens.</p>
    <p>She felt weaker after that, but the other thoughts were still.
      However, the map was still clear in her memory, tracking something
      that was an enemy to this Q'l-hrui aspect. The hate, though, she
      did not need, it did not suit her temperament; but she was all
      aboard with a temporary alliance aimed at frustrating attempts to
      murder her here by pseudo-magical means. In her mind she saluted the
      broken-down installation, and turned away, her thoughts overrun by
      her adjusting to her new realization of her situation.</p>
    <p>So enwrapt was she in her thoughts, that she took little heed of
      the direction in which her feet were taking her, more concerned with
      the next stages of this confrontation in which she had become
      unwillingly entangled. And so, when she surfaced a while later, to
      look consciously at the world again, it took more than, a few
      seconds to figure out where she was, that she was following the line
      of pylons in the direction that the guided party had taken, and the
      same direction in which she had been advised that one of the enemy
      still remained. Two opposed installations, so close?</p>
    <p>She walked on, curiosity winning over her frantic self-analysis.
      She crossed through the row of trees that at a distance had looked
      much denser than they now seemed, and saw that they marked the end
      of the pylons, and through the trees she saw why. The darkness she
      had taken at distance to be the shadow of a deeper mass of woods was
      revealed as a field of totally black substance, dull under the now
      leaden sky, the expanse uninviting with the cool wind that had
      started to pick up, gusting across it fitfully.</p>
    <p>Squatting down, she reached out tentatively to touch the surface,
      but it was just as glassy as it looked, no strange textures or
      reactions to her cautious fingertips. There was something disturbing
      about it, though what caused the feeling was not clear. What was
      clear was that indeed it was the enemy, and possibly their
      equivalent of the stone circle.</p>
    <p>Respectfully, she backed away, senses extended, waiting lest her
      presence had been revealed to that which hunted her. Assured that
      there was no-one in sight, no sign of the unmistakable though
      pattern of her pursuer, Nancy retraced her steps, circling the hill
      of standing stones, and back across the river. From there on she
      felt almost safe; among people and to some degree hidden.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Bree was in the front lounge as Nancy returned to the hotel, and
      greeted her like a long-lost friend, hugging her tight, and kissing
      her on the cheek.
    </p>
    <p>&#8220;Hey, girl &#8211; people will think we're an item, or at least
      having a fling!&#8221; Nancy remarked as she disengaged herself, though
      feeling perhaps not entirely averse to the concept.</p>
    <p>&#8220;Maybe not like that... But with what happened this morning,
      it's as if we were soulmates of some kind, like we had met in some
      previous existence&#8230;&#8221;</p>
    <p>Nancy, too had started to have suspicions along those lines? Was
      this somewhat air-headed woman being used by some antagonistic
      Q'l-hrui force, was she indeed the one she had faced and nearly
      fallen to last night? Cautiously she reached out a faintest sensory
      probe. And found nothing&#8212; not an absence of abnormality, but a
      total absence of all function on any of the few surface levels she
      could reach in such manner, as if the Bree persona was a shell over
      an essential hollowness.</p>
    <p>&#8220;Who knows,&#8221; she replied, now strongly believing that she was
      facing a, possibly unwitting, puppet, &#8220;but now we've met, now
      what?&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;Getting to know a bit more about each other, that sort of
      thing. And I do believe they've started serving tea.&#8221;</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Back in her room, Nancy breathed a sigh of relief. At least Bree
      had carried the burden of the small-talk, random anecdotes from a
      string of worlds where she had wandered, such a contrast to her own
      rather cloistered past, even with the whole scope of Castle Wolf to
      have grown up in, until time to get changed for dinner. But now
      what?</p>
    <p>She sorted through her scant wardrobe, wishing that she still had
      the night combat kit, even just the fuligin body paint, that she had
      left back home, somewhere in one of those scattered bags and boxes
      strewn around her suite, assembling the darkest colours, and
      bundling her hair under a cap. Thus attired, for whatever the night
      might bring, and not for dinner, she slipped out of the hotel room,
      and out into the streets.</p>
    <p>Evening was drawing in under a leaden sky, lights coming on
      against the gloom, as she walked; her mood matched the skies, and
      not the superficial cheer of people and the bright lights around
      her, and it was almost a comfort to pass the outskirts, finally
      coming to the slope leading, in time, down to the river.</p>
    <p>Beyond the lights, she paused a while as her eyes adapted,
      realising that in some respects the visibility was better than it
      had been the previous night, with the clouds above reflecting the
      city's brightness, a poor echo of the ring-light she had grown up
      with, but she still moved cautiously across the rough ground,
      retracing her steps of the night before, listening with ears and
      with mind for any signs of pursuit. But all she could hear was the
      sound of trees rustling and the roar of the wind, as fitful gusts
      picked up; and when passing through under the trees, the occasional
      ominous creaking that brought to mind the fallen trunks she had seen
      this way.</p>
    <p>Quickly as she could pick her way through the darkness, and the
      drifts of twigs and small branches brought down by the winds, she
      emerged from the trees, and gained the riverside path. Gone were the
      mists of the previous night, not even the faintest wisps, all
      dissipated on the wind, which plucked at her clothing as she crossed
      the bridge, grabbing her cap and sending it to fall somewhere, her
      hair spilling out. So much for camouflage &#8211; not, she thought, that
      it would be much use in the confrontation she anticipated.</p>
    <p>Beyond the trees on the far bank, the hill with the standing
      stones was a deeper darkness than the sky, nothing wakened there as
      yet, but the energies gathering were palpable as she headed away
      from the river, feeling her way, guided by their pull. At her
      breast, the Q'l-hrui gem had begun to flicker with blue light, but
      so far, more to be seen than to see by. Above, what had been a
      featureless sky, distantly lit by the city, showed signs of motion,
      a stirring on the gale.</p>
    <p>At last, out from cover, with that faint glow from the flowing
      cloud above, she strode up the hill; and as she climbed, she could
      see faint blue light gathering in response at the base of the
      columns. Reaching the wall, she paused. This was the boundary, the
      point of commitment. A deep breath, and she stepped over.</p>
    <p>Again, that sense of transition, that this was not the world she
      was accustomed to; and the feeling, presence, of Vaelithra, as if
      looking over he shoulder, blossomed. The sounds of the wind as it
      pushed her up the last few yards awoke memories of the sounds that
      had triggered the gem, that first night she had found it. The
      standing stones were all alight with electric blue glow as she
      stepped into the ring, stopping at the centre to look all around,
      bracing against the wind as the presence surged up, and she felt
      herself dissolve once again into the ecstatic trance that it
      offered. That first time, she had been cut down by a simple stun
      beam; here within the Q'l-hrui veil, there should be no such
      mundane attacks.</p>
    <p>No mundane ones, but in that moment of glory, the Other struck, a
      blast of subtle energies that tore at her extended self; it was
      Vaelithra that responded, firing back in kind. The remaining core
      that was Nancy just looked on as from afar, and could feel that, as
      the struggle continued, she was likely the weaker party. So, this
      would indeed be it.</p>
    <p>Rents were forming in the clouds above, patches of stars and
      nebulae showing, and she watched their beauty even as she felt
      herself being eroded. Silvery glow appeared around the fringes of
      the remaining cloud, bringing more light, bringing &#8230; hope?</p>
    <p>&#8220;This is not me! I am not Vaelithra! I am not a puppet of the
      Q'l-hrui!&#8221; she shouted, at least in her mind, if not vocally.</p>
    <p>The light brightened, and she continued to fight back against all
      the alien influences.</p>
    <p>&#8220;I am Nancy... Elanor&#8230;&#8221; she declared</p>
    <p>The last of the clouds were stripped away from the full moon, in
      the sky both in the outer world and the inner.</p>
    <p>&#8220;I&#8230; am&#8230; the&#8230; WOLF!&#8221;</p>
    <p>She reached for the thing that was riding her as a puppet, and
      took it in her jaws, wolfing it down, even as the Other continued to
      rain down its hatred. The energies that had driven her were now
      hers, and she sprang, catching the Other by surprise at the change
      of initiative. It fought back at her as she snapped at it, tearing
      chunks from it that served only to feed her further, but it was
      lumbering and slow, and her harrying soon turned into outright
      feasting, as she stripped its being and devoured it, until only a
      human infant remained.</p>
    <p>Nancy sniffed at it, and deemed it harmless; weary and sated
      after the battle, she lay down to sleep, curling herself around the
      defenceless one.
    </p>
    <hr />

    <p>Bright morning, skies that looked rain-washed, though the night
      had remained dry, the winds of the previous night all gone to calm.</p>
    <p>Nancy opened her eyes to the sunlight, and stretched out silver
      furred paws. A moment of confusion, then recollection &#8211; ah, yes,
      like this : a hand, and then a paw again. Getting to her feet, she
      saw Bree curled up beside her, her evening wear rather bedraggled,
      looking like the discarded Q'l-hrui puppet than she had been. She
      sniffed cautiously. Yes, she had soiled herself too, just like an
      infat.</p>
    <p>Cautiously, she reached out her mind, realising as she did that
      this was now her, not an adjunct of an artifact, doing that. File
      that away for later, too, she thought. She was hesitant as she
      actually contacted Bree, afraid of what she might find. There was no
      Q'l-hrui taint, that she was sure of at the first touch; but not
      much else either. The real Bree was truly the infant whose image she
      had revealed at the end of the battle, the vapid adult shell just
      something that had been used by the lumbering hunter that had preyed
      on her, and how many others she could not tell.</p>
    <p>Gently she coaxed little Bree awake, calming her initial rush of
      panic and bewilderment, then, with infinite care, set her on the
      path back to the city, walking alongside her in the now natural
      seeming form of a wolf, stopping only to do a minimum of cleaning up
      at the river. The early hour helped, few were awake, to wonder at
      this strange pair, the seeming dog almost herding the seeming woman,
      and having to be distracted by simple mental misdirection. At the
      door to her room, Nancy shed the wolf, in one ecstatic stretch.
      Naked, of course, she thought, bar, to her surprise, the gem still
      on its chain, its fires diminished.</p>
    <p>She palmed the lock, ushered Bree inside, and guided her into the
      shower while she got herself dressed.</p>
    <p>&#8220;And now, what?&#8221; she mused. No, she wasn't going to be a
      baby-sitter for the next few years, so &#8230; Only one thing to do.</p>
    <p>Checking an ephemeris, she located the direction of the Link
      station, and cast a thought in that direction. Could she reach that
      far?</p>
    <p>&#8220;Hello, Nancy,&#8221; came an avuncular response. So she could
      reach other telepaths, at least, across planetary distances. &#8220;After
      last night's fireworks, we'd been hoping to hear from you.&#8221;</p>
    <p>She hesitated, taken aback.</p>
    <p>&#8220;Well, we would keep an eye on a known, shall we say &#8216;lone
      wolf', while they're still finding their feet. Or when they
      cause a massive Q'l-hrui event,&#8221; the other paused, &#8220;So, what
      sort of assistance are you seeking?&#8221;</p>
    <hr />

    <p>Morning. At last. Those words were not spoken, nor even framed as
      thoughts. They were just a feeling that did come as some sort of
      relief.</p>
    <p>Nancy awoke instantly from a deep sleep, stared at the ceiling.
      She felt felt refreshed, relieved, but somewhat unsatisfied, after a
      day spent being debriefed by the Linkers, then rushed back
      off-planet to catch the next liner taking the outbound route. She
      checked the time.
    </p>
    <p>Ah, nearly that time.</p>
    <p>And as she lay there debating whether to get up, or summon
      coffee, the announcement came. The ship was about to cast off from
      the link station, and she could consign the world of Angharad, the
      city of Halcyon, and Bree to fading memories. Now would be the true
      new start for this lone Wolf.</p>

    <hr class="bar" />

    <h2 id="whatever">Whatever happened to Nancy Wolf?</h2>

    <p>At this point I stopped writing, because the damned gem was
      taking over, and she was becoming more a Jean Grey as Phoenix than
      the original Telzey Matuchek character I had intended.</p>

    <h3>How the story would have finished</h3>

    <p>Bree is, of course, being piloted by the opposing gem. Cue some
      more Andre Norton style Forerunner bits, an obligatory fight scene,
      and Nancy triumphant, a full time super-heroine. Does this develop
      the character? No.</p>

    <p>If I were to try and finish this today, the story would have to
      end with some form of renunciation of the gem, now revealed as some
      Transcendent-tech enabler (rather than being a Power itself, it
      helps bootstrap a human-level being, as well as having some nifty
      abilities). That would move the character on in some degree.</p>

    <p>Bree &#8212; well she ruled herself out as Nancy's life-mate; but I
      think she survives, albeit traumatized, and not entirely certain of
      what happened. She can recover her life and vanishes from the
      tale.</p>

    <h3>What Nancy did next</h3>

    <p>I stopped writing about this time, as I got into cosy
      domesticity, and RPGs took up more of my hobby time. After
      exhausting the immediate charms of <cite>D&amp;D</cite>, and the high
      fantasy genre in general, we thought about trying super-heroes as a
      genre. Given that the state of the art then was
      <cite>Superhero:2044</cite>, and <cite>Villains and
        Vigilantes</cite>, we opted to free-form, meaning I could bring in
      a version of the Nancy-as-Phoenix called Silverwolf. Imagine the
      original Jean Grey Phoenix, but with the appropriate shift of
      colour-scheme, and a wolf-mask instead of the bird outline.
    </p>

    <p>Nancy also made an appearance as a PC in an all-weekend gaming
      session for high powered favourite characters run by <a href="http://www.philmasters.org.uk/"
        title="Home page of the well known RPG hobby personality">Phil
        Masters</a> back in about
      '83. As a mostly-GM, rarely player, I had no really suitable
      characters of my own, so handed Phil a copy of <cite><a href="index.html"
          title="The novella that introduced this character">Moving
          Day</a></cite>, and he produced a set of
      <cite>Champions</cite> stats

      <cite xml:lang="fr" class="breakline" title="name for heroics, cf. the standard Fr. 'nom de guerre'">nom
        d'heroique</cite> to Masque). And yes, there's also a
      reference to Christine Spar, a.k.a. Grendel's grand-daughter in
      there, too.
    </p>

    <p>At this point Nancy's motivations were that, having managed
      to get back to a critical point in the past, to make sure that things
      turn out better. In '98 I wrote the following tiny <a id="authority">fragment</a> to start another
      episode, set c.2003, nearly 15 years after Pushover's retirement
      from the superhero business:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Cold wind and rain lashed the streets as Carolyn left
        the conference centre to return to her hotel, tired after a day of
        frustrating meetings. What point, she wondered, was there in trying
        to make any sense of a development policy for the third world at a
        time like this, when the whole world had suddenly become an
        underdeveloped country, at least according to the enigmatic Woman
        from the Future?</p>

      <p>It was hard to think that it was only a few days
        since the announcement that had cut across all broadcast channels
        and spammed every newsgroup and mailbox, that the future was
        flawed, and that things would have to turn out differently this
        time, followed by a torrent of sightings, enigmas and hysteria.
        There were large structures in orbit, confused reports of halts or
        interruptions of fighting in the Balkans and in Africa, and all
        sorts of religious outbreaks, and continued random broadcasts of
        various technical data.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>in which her motivation is to make sure that the Singularity
      happens before significant migrations into space, so there aren't
      folk such as herself left behind. She has become a one-woman Peace
      Authority (as per Vinge's <cite>The Peace War</cite>) ; before I
      encountered Jenny Sparks and her Authority beginning to tread a
      similar path to a finer world.</p>

    <p>I'm developing this into a new story called <a href="../authority/index.html"
        title="SF Novella [UNFINISHED] started 2001">Castles in the Sky</a>,
      available as a work in progress locally.</p>

    <h3 id="meanwhile">Meanwhile, back at the future</h3>

    <p>While preparing this page, it became obvious that Nancy had
      become one of the ways I externalized growing up and leaving home.
      Almost twenty five years on, I know I'm different; so what would
      happen to Nancy?</p>

    <p>I have this image of her, maybe fifty years later. She is
      sitting at a table, alone, after a meal, a nearly empty glass of
      red wine to hand. She looks slightly older, a little softening of
      fat over the sinews and muscle, and is lazily content. The night
      sky arches above outside a great dome. She is content, and looks
      back at her youthful folly and exuberance with faint amusement. She
      has never gone home.</p>

    <h3>Distinctive Appearance</h3>

    <p>Besides looking like a black and white photo, with some grey
      pigments instead of haemoglobin and melanin, of course her fingers
      show the distinctive mark of the werewolf (long ring finger,
      IIRC).</p>

    <p>Her hair is silvery, as are her irises. Her eyebrows are
      gun-metal and of course meet in the middle, and fan out at the
      sides almost merging into the hair at her temples. Her eyelashes
      are also gun-metal, and are long and thick. She has a noticeable
      and uniform fine silvery down over her entire body from neck down,
      thinning, but present, on the palms of the hands and absent only
      due to wear on the soles of her feet. Not enough to be furry, it
      would, if darker or coarser in texture be noticeably hairy; a
      common add-on to the Clan phenotype, to improve the retention of
      warm air close to the skin &#8212; a useful feature on icy worlds.</p>

    <p>But see <a href="../authority/index.html" title="SF Novella [UNFINISHED] Stared 2001">Castles in the Sky</a>
