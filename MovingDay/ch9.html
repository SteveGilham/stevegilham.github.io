    <p>Distantly, like wrong-way through a telescope, like a dream at a
      distance, while Nancy used Valerie's senses, Tricia used them too.
      In the depths of her being, cameo-like, it even so obliterated the
      widescreen productions of dream, pushing her into a state of
      awareness of mind while yet her body slept.</p>

    <p>In that miniature of reported reality, she saw the carg girl
      reach down, grasp the helmet, and tear it free. The caress of minds
      from Nancy reached her, and then the bridge between them was gone,
      snapping from tautness, recoiling into her mind in flaring light.
      She opened her eyes, and saw her own room, dark in the midnight.
      She rolled across to the bedside table and looked at her watch. The
      hour was 00:54, a time she was more accustomed to treat as a time
      to go to bed, rather than for getting up.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Genevieve. Status report.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;DawnCastle is delayed, while emergency work is done on part of
      the keel, which fractured during stress-up. Military activity
      continues as before. Latest estimates make time to lift-off for
      Castle Wolf as eighty three hours. Do you want anything more than
      that?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Yes. Get this to Jeanne &#8212; Nancy is in High Prospect, being held
      by matts who are trying to indoctrinate her enough to convince her
      to lead an attack on the Castle. We've got to try and rescue
      her.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;How, Tricia? You're letting your emotions run away with you. All
      the castles are bottled up, so no one can get in or out, and
      that'll be so even when we lift, as long as we stay within
      planetary jurisdiction, and apart from us, there's no one who will
      do the job. The police won't and the guild can't.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;But surely in a place like High Prospect there'd be some
      traditionalist paramilitaries we could contact.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;But not without having the call tapped and traced as soon as it
      entered the city net. There's nothing that will fly, nothing at
      all. I know, I've checked them all. I'm sorry, Trish, but my
      analysis nets are designed to handle facts, not wishful thinking.
      If anything comes up that might work you and Jeanne will hear of
      it.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Thanks.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Tricia spoke that last word with a voice tinged with gloom, and
      resignation to the inevitable. She sat in her bed, staring into the
      darkness, watching the sporadic play of false colour in her eyes,
      and seething at her total helplessness in the face of the events
      that were overwhelming her.</p>

    <p>A thought occurred to her, one that at first turned a little of
      her futile anger upon herself for thinking of it and then grew more
      and more attractive &#8212; if it could be fulfilled. She climbed out of
      bed, and clothing herself in her cape, went to seek out a friend,
      any friend. Surely even at this hour they could not all be asleep
      or otherwise engaged. In any case, she would find out.</p>

    <hr />
    <p>Around High Prospect, a dozen furtive figures spread out from
      the tower where Nancy had been held, wary of the official police,
      of the corporation directed matts, and of possible pro-clan
      activists, as eager to avoid any of these as to find Nancy Elanor
      of Wolf.</p>

    <p>They had covered the tower, and knew that she was not there.
      Even when they had tapped the environmental control sensor system,
      there had been no sign of her. Therefore, by some means, though its
      details be unimportant, she had escaped the tower unnoticed.</p>

    <p>So they must search elsewhere, and so they did, efficiently,
      swiftly, eager to conclude the search before the area they must
      cover grew too wide. But wide as they spread their net, they had
      little or no success; and what success they had was in the negative
      sense of going unnoticed by their rival groups. None of the
      searchers ever bothered to notice the red eyes that glowed betimes
      in the corona of their lights. There were, after all, not
      interested in the local wildlife.</p>

    <hr />
    <p>Nancy was woken by the cold. Though the actual numeric value of
      it would probably have been 280, well within the range of her
      tolerance of hypothermia, it sufficed to send her into violent fits
      of shivering as she lay unclothed in the dew-wet grass. The sun was
      not yet risen, but it would do so within the hour, though closer
      she could not guess. Dawn was always so different to a
      reversed-time sunset, and though she saw the sun go down many
      times, she rarely saw it rise, and had not learned the signs to
      tell its timescale.</p>

    <p>The sky, however, was content to go its own way, to lighten more
      slowly than the eye could follow. As yet, it was blue, but deep
      blue, more nearly purple than was the midday sky. In the east,
      fingerlings of cloud were touched with the first colours of a sun
      reaching itself over the edge of a world. She was captivated by the
      beauty of the scene.</p>

    <p>Above her, a tree reached up into that heaven, and spread its
      leaves wide over her, and she nestled among the bushes that crowded
      around its base. Eastwards, ten yards away, the grass ended, and
      the grassland proper took over. Between the arch of two trees, the
      dawn yellowed a tiny patch of sky and blushed far more into
      peach-pink.</p>

    <p>The world was not silent either. A faint morning breeze stirred
      the leaves, and the lizards warbled. Across the open ground, at the
      base of one of the border trees, a tree-rat sat, and chattered
      angrily at something.</p>

    <p>In among that harmless chorus, something new, something alien,
      something dangerous. The voices of people, at first distant, but
      approaching from behind her, out of the wood. She turned,
      carefully, quietly, to peek from behind the tree, hoping that the
      dawn behind her would blind any watchers to her presence, poorly
      advanced, though that wakening of the day might be.</p>

    <p>As they came closer, out of the gloom, Nancy could put locations
      to the speakers, two of them, and dressed in paramilitary uniforms.
      She could not see any badges, but she could see the colour, a
      mottled green and brown, with black and yellow splashes. None of
      the Clans used other than monochrome battle-dress, and there were
      so few pro-Clan forces that it would be safer to discard that
      possibility as an operating hypothesis.</p>

    <p>The pair were Ayassa, a female and a male, much smaller, by her
      side</p>

    <p>&#8220;Let's give up now,&#8221; he suggested, &#8220;we've been searching for the
      little minx for six hours now. Hell, she could have practically
      walked to the Guild port in all that time. I'd not reckon on her
      staying anywhere near the heat, at least I wouldn't, and by all
      accounts, she's not stupid.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;OK. We'll get back to the car, and say so.&#8221; The tall girl
      stretched herself further as she yawned, catlike as ever her people
      were. &#8220;I could do with a few hours sleep now.&#8221;</p>

    <p>So slowly, they moved past, unhurried in their walking, out into
      the grassland, striking to the right, and passing beyond sight.
      Their voices faded.</p>

    <p>A trap? She thought not. The mechanism was far too complicated
      for that. It would just be enough to point a gun in her direction
      now, and tell her to stand to get her out of the bushes, given she
      had been noticed. On the other hand, however, it would do no harm
      to wait a while longer before moving. Slowly, one number to the
      second, Nancy began to count, and continued until she had reached
      the count of two thousand. And all that half hour, she was cold,
      and her hunger was like barbed wire. The sun, slowly, approached
      the horizon, and the sky above it began to blaze brightly.</p>

    <p>In all that time, she remained alone, neither hearing nor seeing
      any other matts. It was enough for her. She stood, with joints
      creaking and muscles aching, protesting at the sudden change of
      posture, abrupt after hours of huddling.</p>

    <p>A mile away, below her, and across a wide lake, its colour still
      the deepest of blues, lay High Prospect. Twenty five miles away on
      the far side lay the Guild port, and the sanctuary of the Embassy
      there. Her home was besieged, and besides, two hundred fifty times
      as far, so it would have to be the port. Without shoes, walking was
      out. Therefore as a direct consequence, some poor unsuspecting
      person would, have to be relieved of his car &#8212; there would be less
      difficulty in that than acquiring footwear.</p>

    <p>For once the decision that she, and the others of the Clans be
      educated among the folk of their world had a beneficial side
      effect, in as much as she had acquired one reasonably trustworthy
      friend resident in the city, one to whom she had intended to flee
      under cover of night.</p>

    <p>The question that she had put aside a dozen time before rose
      again to plague her. Why was she here, and how? and how come she
      had no memory of the preceding nine hours? She could make no
      definite conclusions, only fearfully speculate that the Linna
      personality that had been embedded in the necklace had taken
      control. It was something she could think about, or try to avoid
      thinking about, while she walked.</p>

    <hr />
    <p>The city lay in the middle of a piece of sign writing on the
      planet's surface, where a bulls-eye design had been carved out of
      the forest for the guidance of incoming spacecraft, its centre
      astride one of the radial arms. Nancy was on the one side, and her
      goal on the other, across open land, devoid of cover, and with
      potentially hostile eyes to watch her. There was no recourse than
      to use the only cover open to her, the city itself, trusting to the
      early hour to keep her from the notice of casual passers-by.</p>

    <p>She followed under the eaves of the trees, the course of the
      pattern, until she struck an out-stretched arm of slideway to take
      her as she wanted. Its surface was as chill after the night as its
      arctic appearance might suggest, yet as it moulded itself to her
      feet, and was warmed, it was more comfortable than the vegetation
      strewn earth that she had covered to reach it.</p>

    <p>As she had planned, she took the direct route, under a sky
      lightening to dawn, observed only by the unconscious maintenance
      robots. The buildings &#8212; houses or shops &#8212; all turned their blind
      windows on her. Yet there was an aura as if someone watched her.
      The open sky above worried her, more so when the sun began to edge
      over the horizon, casting long and unmistakable shadows, with its
      M-coloured light. The direct rays were hot, making her skin bead
      uncomfortably with sweat, despite the rushing, chill of the air.
      She did not like this part of dawn, where its quiet mystery was
      transformed into the humdrum rush of daytime. The night was more
      the time for her, she decided.</p>

    <p>The sun was its own width above the horizon, and she five miles
      along the line, deep into the forest, when she reached her
      destination, a clearing where a house had been built, one of a
      score or so strung sparsely along that particular slideway spur.
      Nancy stepped off onto the grassy verge, kicking up the dew, and
      walked closer to the house. Each and every window was opaqued,
      which was not particularly surprising, given the time of day. But
      in a couple of hours &#8212; given that the family had not gone off
      somewhere in the meantime &#8212; it would be a temporary refuge.</p>

    <p>There was only really one place to go, however, to wait out the
      time, the only place that would conceal her even from infrared eyes
      in orbit &#8212; the stable behind the place, which being built in the
      archaic style of such constructions, would be easier to enter. And
      so she did, finding in the hayloft a warmer, and no less
      comfortable place to bed down than the place she had woken. There
      would be no difficulty in getting to sleep; the fatigue weighed
      heavy on her, as if she had been active all of the night, bedding
      down to sleep only shortly before the dawn. Her eyes closed of
      their own accord, and the horsey noises beneath her resting place
      did not impede her drift into a light but dream-fevered sleep.</p>

    <p>The sound of a cheerful voice cut through her repose, and she
      forced her bleary eyes open, and crawled to a place where she could
      look down into the stable proper. Beneath her, feeding handfuls of
      hay to a chestnut mare in one of the stalls, was just the person
      she had been looking for.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Alan!&#8221; her voice sounded unusual, for her mouth was gummy with
      thirst. He looked up from feeding the horse.</p>

    <p>&#8220;My god. Nancy What the hell are you doing here?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Looking for somewhere to cadge a breakfast and some transport.
      How come I'm here, and stark naked, when I should be at home and
      enjoying my lunch, well, it's rather long and involved.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Hiding after that brouhaha on the news the other night?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Thereabouts.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Hell, that's okay. Come on in. Let's shock my parents with what
      I've found.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;OK, but not too much.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;My Lady, would I do anything like that?&#8221;</p>

    <p>Nancy did not bother to answer.</p>

    <hr />
    <p>Nancy flew the car as fast as she dared along the approach
      radius, letting her course wind about the hills shielding the town
      from the port, keeping her altitude as low as she dared, and
      certainly no higher than the minimum that regulations demanded.
      Again in compliance with regulations, she kept her speed down to
      four hundred miles per hour, which was slower than she could have
      managed on manual, but a limit that she adhered to to minimize her
      noticablity.</p>

    <p>Half way, two minutes more to safety, a cheering thought,
      despite her almost paranoid fear of ambush; she counted off the
      miles and seconds eagerly in her haste to be done with it all.</p>

    <p>Ninety seconds she counted off, and the great plain that formed
      the starport opened out before her, over the crest of the last low
      ridge of hills. It was then, with her goal in sight, that she
      noticed the car following hers. Disregarding everything else, Nancy
      poured power to her car, skipping it over the last ridge, and
      bringing it down screaming, at just short of Mach one &#8212; however she
      might need to hurry, to stun or kill innocent bystanders would
      prejudice her case. Besides, it would be difficult enough to land
      the car under those conditions.</p>

    <p>The pursuing car matched her every move, even as she brought her
      own vehicle down in the quickest landing she could devise, heading
      it straight for the embassy buildings, then cutting in reverse
      thrust. Safety webbing caught her in a suffocating grip for a few
      hundreds of milliseconds, as the car, protesting, lurched to a
      stop. It was still drifting slowly forwards as Nancy vaulted out
      and began to run the last yards.</p>

    <p>She was not yet in official sanctuary territory. The manoeuvre
      had been clumsy enough to require her to stop in the relatively
      uncluttered field a hundred yards or so short. The crowds milling
      about, transferring to ships or cars, scattered about her, and more
      vigorously yet when bullets began to fly, stitching across the
      concrete almost beneath her feet. She ignored them. Tangline was
      the only thing that could be used to capture her in a state where
      she would be immediately useful to the matts, and a bullet would
      have to be a killing shot if they wished to stop her this close to
      her goal. Then, all they would likely benefit by would be her
      memory, which could at best be only a long term weapon against the
      Clan.</p>

    <p>A burst of fire rang, out, and impossible pain sprouted in her
      right leg, just below the knee. She stumbled a few more steps, then
      fell awkwardly. She began to drag herself across the rough
      concrete, scraping her hands, and snagging her clothes. She waited
      for them to come for her, as she inched painfully forwards,
      shattering fingernails for every inch she gained.</p>

    <p>The waiting seemed to go on forever, and at last, she turned her
      head to look behind her. The two matts who had left their car to
      follow her afoot had stopped., and were slinging their weapons.
      Between them and her, a yellow line was painted on the concrete,
      the borderline. The embassy steps were only ten yards beyond where
      she lay and there were too many Port security guards around to make
      a violation of neutrality worthwhile.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Well done, Nancy,&#8221; one of them called, &#8220;You fight well. But that
      was only one battle. We're not finished; one day the Clans will be
      dispersed, Tell the Lady Jeanne that.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Then he spoke again, in a louder voice, and not addressing her
      specifically.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Hey! There's a girl here been shot. She's bleeding badly.
      Someone call a medic.&#8221;</p>

    <p>And he saluted Nancy, and Nancy returned that salute, and then
      he and his companion turned and walked away.</p>

    <p>Crazy honour. Better than we showed, though, My god &#8212; they may
      be right after all. Oh, let that be wrong. What a garbage heap my
      mind is.</p>

    <p>In response to the call, and the flurry of events, two nurses
      came out of the Embassy, and gently laid Nancy on a stretcher, and
      took her through the great golden doors. Now that everything was
      resolved, and the Linkers in control, Nancy let herself faint from
      shock.</p>
