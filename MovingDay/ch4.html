  <div id="content">
    <p>All was dark; and in that darkness, something stirred, a
      primeval, bestial force. Nancy felt it bubble up from the lightless
      depths of her self, like marsh gas, bringing with it taints of all
      she disliked about herself, dragging her in its wake, from the
      borders of dream, reluctantly to full wakefulness. Raw, hot animal
      desire was uppermost in that turmoil of id-thoughts washing up from
      far below the lighted shallows of consciousness, and drowsily, she
      began to respond. Already she held another in her arms, so she
      nuzzled closer, caressing, the cool skin of her back, and kissing
      her, before she had finished waking.</p>

    <p>But the unveiling of her consciousness brought clarity to the
      drive that had grown within her. She opened her eyes and considered
      the scene. It was not the young girl with hair of silver brightness
      in the ring-glow, the fine slender body against her own, that was
      the focus of her lust, but an inert construct of stone and metal,
      tens of millions of years old, a chain and a gem in a museum a
      quarter of a world away.</p>

    <p>Her first impulse was to sick fear, but that door was denied
      her. There was to be no easy flight into hysteria, and that,
      intellectually, frightened her still more, for she would be
      perfectly aware of all that would be happening if it erased her.
      Coldly, then, she turned to fight, to drive away the attack upon
      her will, but there was no clear avenue by which to direct her
      counterthrust, no point of especial weakness, apparent to her, and
      without such guide, her resistance was foredoomed to failure.</p>

    <p>Reluctantly bowing to the inevitable, Nancy decided to cease the
      struggle, to yield to the pressure. Maybe there would come an
      opportunity to break free, maybe not, but she would wait, and be
      ready should it come. As for the present, she would do what she had
      to.</p>

    <p>Nancy slipped carefully from Julie's loose embrace, rolling her
      gently away. She snored slightly in the new position, but otherwise
      it seemed that her sleep was undisturbed. Even so, Nancy watched
      all the time for the slightest signs of awakening, as gently she
      wriggled out of the bed, and crawled onto the floor. Only when
      carpet was beneath her hands and knees, did she attempt to stand,
      careful not to misjudge her balance in the uncertain light.</p>

    <p>She moved across to her table, disliking the rustling of her
      footfalls, to check the time by her watch. It showed, now adjusted
      to the local values, 23:49, a comparatively early hour, as the
      lights still burning aplenty in the windows she could see agreed.
      Early enough, maybe, that the Castle as a community would still be
      awake, yet too late, by an hour and a half, to reach the museum by
      the 00:34 deadline</p>

    <p>She shook her head, attempting to clear her mind, but all she
      achieved for her pains was vertigo. The compulsion remained, now
      become part of her she could neither isolate nor subvert. She
      turned her back on the brightly ring lit black and silver
      roofscape, and went in the next room to find clothes and equipment
      for her task.</p>

    <p>White was the colour of her choice, a colour that would be
      camouflaged against the white of concrete, should she be forced
      onto the rooftops or open boulevards. It was certainly for no other
      reason, practical or symbolic. Coveralls she chose, with boots of
      white leather, and a belt of the same material. Contrasting with
      these, she unpacked two guns, a stunner, and a blaster, home-made
      both, and of unpainted materials, save, on the latter where
      radiator fins had a black crackle finish. They were ugly but
      functional, and had no part in her outfit other than of pure
      practicality &#8212; they could never be aesthetic.</p>

    <p>There was nothing else that appeared useful, as far as she
      noticed, either in rummaging through her case or searching through
      her room. So she would travel light &#8212; it suited her fine.</p>

    <p>She sat down at the desk, and switched on the computer console,
      selecting the non-sentient part of the mechanism.</p>

    <p>She paused, sighed, and began to type her message, so that Julie
      would know where she was going, and why, and Nancy's guesses as to
      what exactly was happening.</p>

        <p>Saying farewell</p>
      </div>
    </div -->

    <p>As Nancy slipped out though the door, an instruction for Julie
      to read from the file glowed blue-grey against the dark screen,
      like the rings beyond against the vaster and paler screen of the
      night. The room she left admitted no more light, by her
      instructions, than was required to see by and not walk into things,
      but here, in the corridor, the illumination was greater, and she
      trusted herself to jog-trot, trusting that living in a mainly
      uninhabited block, no one would be abroad at that hour.</p>

    <p>She paused only at junctions, to check that she went unobserved,
      retracing her route of that afternoon, taking her bridge at a run,
      and the pausing in the far corner of the room to readapt her eyes.
      Through the soft darkness of the junk-room she crept, stepping
      gently over obstacles, until she recognized, in the distance ahead
      of her, what was the cause of the sound she heard. Voices nearby
      were raised in revelry, in the midst of a precinct rarely disturbed
      by human presence.</p>

    <p>Stalking the source of the sound, she passed along the corridor,
      and with every step she took, she became more certain, until at
      last she beheld with her own eyes that the old hall was full of
      feasters. She felt reluctant to pass by in view of that gathering,
      urged to it by the thing that piloted her. She toyed with the idea
      of calling for help, however reluctant she might normally be, but
      she could not step from thought to action, and instead resorted to
      silent curses against the group that made the hall its meeting
      place.</p>

    <p>Resignedly, she tuned back, considering the possible routes she
      might take to her aircar. It would, she decided after careful
      deliberation, have to be the roof &#8212; only just over twenty minutes
      remained until the deadline expired, and local airspace became
      unfriendly. She regained the bridge, and looked up and sniffed. She
      muttered faintly to herself and then began to climb along the piton
      route set there. The climb itself was more annoying than strenuous
      but had she not travelled that path before, to set pitons and
      improve footholds, it would have been impossible</p>

    <p>Standing on the flat roof, she had two choices &#8212; a two mile
      walk, or a quarter of a mile of climbing sloping roof. The first
      looped back the way she had come, longer than she dared
      contemplate; the second began ahead of her, where the grey tiled
      roof of the hall rose from the dark and glistened damply in the
      ring-glow. Golden light, and festive noise spilled out from the
      small window in the end wall, which a few hours before had admitted
      the last afternoon light.</p>

    <p>Nervously, she checked around, and saw behind her spray of pale
      lines spring into existence, low in the north-east and there to
      dance nervously around &#8212; the time had come for another bomb run,
      and one of the minor batteries was acquiring targets. The dance
      halted, and the pencils of light began to spread out from their
      source, at first slowly, then bursting out. One whipped towards
      Nancy, scratching sparks from the lifter field as it drank in the
      energy.</p>

    <p>Three puffs of light, and a drumroll of sound marked the
      perfection of mechanized marksmanship, but failed by orders of
      magnitude to overwhelm it. That would come soon however, in a
      continuous rain of saturation bombing, until something got
      through.</p>

    <p>In the remade still of the night, Nancy began her climb,
      barefoot now, trading comfort for purchase on the cold and clammy
      roof, aware that she would bruise her heels properly that night.
      While she climbed, a single, half-hearted explosion, presumably
      something to do with the previous three, roared in the night above,
      and its suddenness startled her a little, but not enough to
      interrupt the climb.</p>

    <p>On hands and knees, she crossed the roofcrest, following its
      narrow purchase, and to her minor annoyance, accumulated grey and
      green smears on the knees of her coveralls. There would be more of
      that in time, as she gathered moss and lichen stains from other
      rooftops.</p>

    <p>At the end of that section, a six foot drop brought her onto a
      stretch of flat roof &#8212; ahead, the corridor she had followed that
      afternoon, and to the right, for a score of yards, another with a
      crested roof crossing it. She headed for it at a run, her momentum
      carrying her up the slope, and grabbed for the crest.</p>

    <p>For a while, she waited there, looking at what lay ahead. At the
      bottom of the slope, a four foot gap opened, separating roof from
      roof, showing her the top floor windows in the opposite block. One
      window was lit slightly to the left of where she lay, and the
      occupant was sitting in plain sight. She was blonde, her skin light
      brown, and that was enough for Nancy to recognize her. Tricia &#8212; no
      doubt in one of her own secret apartments.</p>

    <p>Nancy swung herself over the roofcrest, and slid down the far
      side. There was a small wall, about a foot high, around the roof,
      and another on the far side, and they were wide enough to make
      reasonable stepping stones, despite not having, been designed with
      that purpose in mind.</p>

    <!-- div class="hide">
      <div style="padding:5px;border: black 1px solid;text-align: center;background-color: #eee;color:inherit">
        <img height="384" width="688" src="00795-2551528066.png" />
        <p>On the rooftops</p>
      </div>
    </div -->

    <p>She stood on the first, not caring to let her gaze descend to
      the fifty yard chasm at her feet, and estimated the jump. Given
      grass, or some such, so she could land asprawl if need be the gap
      would be trivial to cover, even from a standing start. As it was,
      she could do it without especial effort, it would hurt is she
      overshot.</p>

    <p>Carefully she dropped into a crouch, swinging her arms to gain
      momentum, and sprang. An interval without duration severed the
      chain of her existence while she flew through the empty air.</p>

    <p>Her heels impacted painfully on the far wall, the gritty surface
      harsh beneath the blow. She was off balance tending to fall
      forwards, and with arms windmilling about to compensate managed to
      regain an upright stance. As soon as she dared, she stepped down,
      so that the wall now prevented a fall</p>

    <p>Coldly she checked the time &#8212; 00:15. Nineteen minutes. It would
      be far more efficient to get inside the castle again, and the force
      that commanded her movements assented to that decision.</p>

    <p>She knelt down, and unclasped her gun belt, lowering it over the
      edge to knock against Tricia's window</p>

    <p>&#8220;Hey! Out here!&#8221; she called</p>

    <p>From where she watched, she could only see that the window gave
      onto a lighted room, with four inches or so of green carpet under
      the window.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Carol Mastersen! Is that you?&#8221; still no response.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Tricia! It's Nancy. Wake up in there!&#8221;</p>

    <p>A window opened, and a face looked up, and smiled</p>

    <p>&#8220;Nancy,&#8221; she asked, &#8220;What the hell are you doing on my roof at this
      time of night?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Long story. Help me down, and I'll give you the whole sordid
      story. Deal?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Deal,&#8221; then, &#8220;Wait a minute, I'll just get something to stand
      on.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Tricia disappeared, but there were noises of movement from the
      opened window, and eventually a table appeared in the part of the
      room she could see.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Nancy. Just swing yourself down, and I'll guide you.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Nancy sat down on the edge of the precipice, and swung her legs
      over the edge, then turned, and lowered her body by her arms.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Can you reach me?&#8221;</p>

    <p>The only reply was Tricia's grasp behind her knees.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Okay. I'll reach down for the gutter now.&#8221;</p>

    <p>This lowered her another fifteen inches. The guttering creaked,
      but held. She had checked the design specs &#8212; the actual safe
      loading was about twice her weight. If anything was likely to fail
      in the near future, it was her grasp where the gutter edge cut into
      her palms.</p>

    <p>&#8220;That it?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Tricia grabbed her around the waist.</p>

    <p>&#8220;You can reach down one arm to the window frame now. I've got
      your weight, that's it. Now the other arm &#8212; hang on to the window
      frame and I'll lower your feet to the table. OK now. Done.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Nancy slipped the embrace, and jumped down onto the floor,
      sweeping her gaze around the room, seeking a door out.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Nancy &#8212; what is it?&#8221;</p>

    <p>She hardly heard, that question, locked in that alien trance
      until Tricia shook her by the shoulder, and asked again.</p>

    <p>&#8220;What's the matter? Why the guns?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I can't explain properly, I've put the details under keyword
      <a href="annot.html#Sapphire"><code>sapphire</code></a> in my part of
      the general archives. It'll say it better than I can, face to face
      like this. I've told the whole story, or as much as I know. Please
      don't tell anyone until midnight thirty. Promise me, Tricia, It's
      important.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>&#8220;What have you been smoking?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Nothing. I wish I had been. I think I might be burning out at
      last. I mean that &#8212; I think I'm going mad. I'm also armed. Please,
      Trish, help me!&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;How &#8212; I don't know what you're doing, or why?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I'm going back to Uni.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Nancy, don't, please. I love you &#8212; if you get killed out there
      tonight, it could be forever.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Don't you think I realize that? If I had any free will in this
      matter, I'd be safe in bed with Julie Marie. Hold me, Trish, tell
      me I'm dreaming this.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Tricia held her, with Nancy's head rested on her shoulder,
      pressed against her hair. Nancy felt her throat constrict, and her
      breathing disintegrated into sobs, but the tears did not come. She
      tried to force herself to cry, but the attempt failed.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Nancy, Nancy, what is it? You can tell me. Please. I won't mind.
      I'll help you.&#8221; Tricia forced herself to speak words of reassurance,
      as much for her own benefit as Nancy's, while she played the
      situation by ear. She had never had to deal with this sort of thing
      before.</p>

    <p>&#8220;You remember the other night,&#8221; Nancy replied between long dry
      sobs, &#8220;in the museum, the blivit, something from it got into my
      head, and while we were looking for that Connors girl, it woke up
      something else. Then yesterday, when we went there again, it called
      me, stronger than before. I thought I'd beaten it, stopped it, but
      I haven't, it wants me to go to it. I'm scared, Trish, scared sick,
      but it won't let me be. Can you feel that?&#8221;</p>

    <p>She forced her month shut, and took a deep breath, and another,
      and slowly lifted her head, intending to look Tricia straight in
      the face, perhaps to show herself, perhaps to stare her down,
      perhaps to kiss her, but she never completed the action. As she
      lifted her gaze, she saw first the floor, and then the window, and
      through the window, the clear argent greys and ebon blacks on the
      far wall leapt out at her, to torment, and tear. The siren-like
      compulsion clawed at her brain like barbed wire.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Oh God,&#8221; she swore, &#8220;The night. Kill it, Genevieve, Fill it. For
      Hell's name, Genevieve, shut those windows and opaque them.&#8221;</p>

    <p>She threw herself to the floor, moaning.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Shall I, Tricia?&#8221; Entirely neutral, the servitor mode checked
      with the registered occupant the orders it had been given.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Yes. Quickly.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Will that be all?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Yes, thank you.&#8221;</p>

    <p>From where she knelt, Nancy listened to all this in
      uncomprehending hysteria. She could only see the night, which
      seemed to identify itself with the compulsion that had planted
      itself within her mind. So slowly, it seemed, the open panel slid
      into place, and the material became opaque and when the last sliver
      of night was hidden, her skin crawled, and colours swam across her
      sight. There was a funny dark grey green taste in her head, and her
      skin felt cold and clammy, and everything was becoming
      strange&#8230;</p>

    <hr />
    <p>When they sorted themselves out again, she was lying on a bed,
      with Tricia sitting by her. The room was apparently without
      windows, and was lit by a couple of groups of candles, not in the
      cone of her direct sight, She brushed the hair from her face and
      found her forehead slick with cold sweat. She checked her watch
      again 00:18. sixteen minutes to the deadline &#8212; sixteen minutes
      before it would be totally unsafe to leave the Castle, sixteen
      minutes before any decision would be made for her.</p>

    <p>&#8220;You all right now?&#8221; Tricia asked her.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Ooh. Nnh. I think so. Can I have a glass of water my mouth
      tastes all yrrg.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Sure. you stay right there, and after you've had your
      drink&#8230;&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Oh, cut that out, and get me some water. This is goddamned
      serious.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Alright. I will.&#8221; She stood up, and walked, unspeaking away.
      Nancy regretted her temper but couldn't find the words for
      apology.</p>

    <p>When Tricia was gone, Nancy levered herself up onto one elbow,
      and looked around the room. Her attention was caught and held by
      two paintings, apparently of her, on the opposite wall. She
      qualified that statement. Certainly, it seemed that the girl who
      had been the subject for the one, had been subject for the other,
      though the styles of painting differed.</p>

    <p>The first was a formal portrait. The girl was dressed in black,
      and sat with her left quarter to the viewer. Her right elbow rested
      on a table in front of her that appeared only in the bottom of the
      frame. The edge of a chessboard with a game in play, showed there.
      Her haem-coloured hand entwined itself in a lock of her long blonde
      hair. Her face which was Nancy's true face, but for its coloration,
      the same as Nancy's, was woken into a smile of bright and even
      teeth. She wore a necklace of fine gold chain, with a small ingot
      pendant from it. The background was a garden of hedges, and flowers
      and blue skies.</p>

    <p>The second was radically changed from the first. It was a full
      length study, obviously drawn from the imagination. Nancy saw her
      almost-self from the inside of a building standing in the doorway.
      She wore green combat dress, like that of the Clan. Behind her, a
      tracked vehicle moved along the street, and beyond it,. wrecked
      buildings, and a blue sky with faint clouds. The horror of it was
      the face that was not quite her own. While her hands held an
      assault rifle and poured a hail of lead into the room, <a href="annot.html#Lara">her face
        showed neither hate, nor glee engendered of sadism</a>, nor even a
      determination to finish a regretfully necessary task. Rather, it
      seemed, she believed herself to be spreading some holy blessing of
      violent fearful death. Could she be
      capable of that, she wondered disquietingly.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Did you paint those pictures?&#8221; she asked when Tricia returned
      with a tall glass full of water.</p>

    <p>&#8220;No &#8212; I found them, in a junk heap that hadn't been touched for
      the last five hundred years or more. I've asked Genevieve, but even
      she doesn't know or can't remember who she, except that she is
      strongly of the opinion that this is, or was, a real person.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Mother Trixy painted them herself &#8212; the chess playing one is
      dated November 2105, the, ah, other one, spring, year three of the
      landing. That's 2134 ADT reckoning. You can see she was right off
      her rocker when she did it.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Nancy gulped down her water, greedily, letting part of it run
      down her chin and onto her clothes and the bed. When she had
      drained it she sat up.</p>

    <p>&#8220;What can I do, Trish?&#8221;</p>

    <p>Tricia's expression changed abruptly, as if that was a key to
      some distasteful memory. Nancy matched that expression as the great
      weight of despair settled again on her, dark and formless and
      empty. Tricia ventured no suggestion, so forced back to her own
      discretion Nancy made her own decision. She would face the thing
      now, while there was still a chance of arriving safely at the
      University.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Give me my guns back, Tricia. I'm going out there.&#8221;</p>

    <p>She was reluctant to comply, but despite that, she took them
      from the bedside cupboard, but did not hand them over.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I've got to &#8212; can't you see that?&#8221; Nancy implored, reluctant to
      use force against the only person that she might be considered to
      love. &#8220;It's getting stronger all the time. This is the first time
      it's attacked me so strongly outside of the museum, and it's
      thousands of miles away. It only gave me dreams before.</p>

    <p>&#8220;If I don't go to it tonight, I'll be called again tomorrow, and
      again and again, and stronger all the time until we leave &#8212; and
      possibly after that. I can't hide from the night forever. It's
      night in space, after all, and if it can call from light-years
      away&#8230; If I go now, before it gets even stronger, I might succeed
      in stopping it &#8212; and anyway, if I go now, I've still got a margin
      of safety, while I'm on my way.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I'll come with you then, whatever happens to be with you, in
      case&#8230;&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;In case it deletes me.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;No, Tricia. Stay here &#8212; you're safe. It might get you too. If
      anything happens on the way there, or on the way to the Guild port,
      there's no need for both of us to die true death. Come with me to
      my car, if you want, and then give the alarm. A few platoons of the
      guard will be more use to me, however much I would want your
      company, I'm afraid.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Oh Nancy, why did this have to happen to us?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Why not? The Universe doesn't care &#8212; I was just too nosey for my
      own good. That's all. There are now only thirteen minutes left
      before local airspace becomes unsafe. Give me the guns.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Tricia handed them over. Nancy stood and holstered them, and
      looked at Tricia.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Are you coming, just as far as the car?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Yes, I will. I'll just get a coat.&#8221;</p>

    <p>And Tricia took a cloak from a peg by the door, black, lined
      with red satin, shimmering green as it moved, and she draped it
      around herself. Their eyes met, an unspoken reconciliation.</p>

    <p>Nancy held out one hand, and Tricia held it and moved closer,
      and draped the cloak about the two of them.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Twelve minutes. Let's go.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;As you say.&#8221;</p>

    <hr />
    <p>There were no other people about, their absence underlined by
      the lifeless silence in which they walked. Neither girl spoke, each
      had matters too urgent, too overriding to occupy their minds.</p>

    <p>For her part, Nancy had to plan her moves for the hours ahead,
      always with the knowledge that whatever reserve of safety she might
      yet have was fast slipping past, into the dead aeons of history.
      She was afraid, but had claimed a purpose, and dared not let
      herself be distracted. No matter what else followed, if she failed
      now, she would fail her own exacting standards of honour. Not for
      the first time, she regretted the honour that served her as a
      conscience.</p>

    <p>Beside her, Tricia was still overwhelmed by the sudden turn of
      events. She had never conceived the possibility of something like
      this &#8212; it was something that had before always remained safely
      fictional, or at worst, had happened to someone else. Whatever the
      past, the girl who walked beside her now made her feel acutely
      uneasy, for she doubted her sanity. She felt strongly for Nancy,
      and the sense of impending loss, that the person she had known for
      a lifetime would soon be changed beyond recognition, grieved her.
      There was no training for that sort of thing in the life she had
      led. Immortality, the slow changes, apace with ones own maturation,
      the extended family among whom. she lived &#8212; all had served to
      insulate her from the loss of those she knew. Hours before, she had
      parted, presumably irrevocably, with the friends she had won in
      four months of University life, and that had been a shock to her.
      Now, the chance that she should lose someone so close served to
      throw her thinking into confusion.</p>

    <p>She walked as if in a dream, the culmination of the nightmare
      that had grown over the last year. Her body took over for her,
      walking. without needing her direction, holding close against her
      companion, down, into the windowless depths of the ground
      levels.</p>

    <p>Nancy, feeling the night to be crucial to the geas upon her, and
      desiring to cling to her integrity until she no longer could, had
      chosen this easy defiance, but even so, she had at last to climb to
      the level of the courtyard where she had parked her aircar.</p>

    <p>A sense of apocalyptic doom mounted like a thunderhead over her,
      dark and oppressive, and even her awoken sense of self
      preservation, goaded into outraged action, could not shift the
      fatalism it engendered. Adrenaline might be poured into her
      bloodstream, to make her pulse race, and stomach churn, but even to
      sigh quietened the impulse to cower. Besides, there were only six
      minutes left as she climbed the last stair, before the cease-fire
      was at an end.</p>

    <p>Ahead of her, to the right at the top of the stairs was a
      doorway, and they stopped there, before taking the final step that
      could not be turned back. Nancy faced her cousine, sadness on her
      face.</p>

    <p>&#8220;This is it. The end. Once I step out there, it's good-bye. I
      will still be there, but something else will be at the controls.
      Remember, Tricia, remember me in case I fail&#8230; In fifteen
      minutes, send a message to the Lady Jeanne, tell her what's
      happened, tell her to send guards, about two platoons &#8212; and
      remember to tell her the rules we operated under. I don't want to
      be in the middle of any escalation if she sends in any
      cybersoldiers. If you want anything more, I wrote all I could think
      of in the file under keyword <code>sapphire</code>.&#8221;</p>

    <p>She held Tricia to her, and kissed her, feeling the warmth of
      her body, against the cool of the night air. For a minute she held
      that embrace, though the time was precious, then slowly, and with
      regret, broke free. There were tears in her eyes, and in
      Tricias'.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Don't cry, Trish. It's all my fault. Just remember. And remember
      &#8212; I love you.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Tricia pulled her cloak tightly about her, suddenly chilled.
      Nancy retrieved the car keys from the ledge above the door. She put
      her hand on the doorknob, and, partly out of reluctance to do what
      she purposed, partly from a warped sense of the dramatic, turned
      around one last time.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Now I suppose it should be famous last last words time. &#8126;It is a
      far far better thing I do than I have ever done before&#8127; and so on.
      Crap. Be seeing you, Tricia, my love.&#8221;</p>

    <p>The door opened, silver light spilled in where the seal had been
      broken, and now opened wider to admit the flood. Out on the
      concrete of the court, an aircar stood, waiting for her. Nancy
      stepped out towards it, cringing as she exposed herself to the sky,
      as if she awaited physical blow &#8212; but none landed. There was only
      the solitary, metronome beat of her footsteps on the paving, and
      the faint sighing of the breeze; above the changeless dark of the
      sky, cut by the gossamer flame of the rings, about her the castle,
      painted in the light, and underfoot, the grey concrete.</p>

    <p>The door-handle was chill to her grasp, but the door opened
      crisply when she pulled it, and she climbed in, settling herself in
      the driver's seat. She began the cursory preflight checks, and with
      only part of her mind occupied by the task, noticed that the change
      had already come upon her, subtly changing her motivation. No more
      was she committed to the escape by pressure of expediency and
      fatalistic curiosity. Instead she was overcome by an intense and
      yieldless desire for the artifact &#8212; for it as if it was almost a
      person, not merely for the possessing of it as some cheap and gaudy
      trinket or work of high and fine art.</p>

    <p>That, and that alone was the total change, to the best of her
      ability to determine it. In any other respect, she was her own
      mistress, provided that her action didn't directly or potentially
      interfere with the main mission. Whatever had planted that drive
      was possessed of consummate subtlety, developed to excruciating
      precision. It needed nothing as tactless, as brutish, as full
      control of her body, when her own guiding intelligence had been
      subverted, and could do whatever controlling was necessary.</p>

    <p>She shrugged, and slotted the <a href="annot.html#CarKeys">key card</a> into the
      dashboard. She would conserve her will for the showdown, the
      climactic denial of that control, when at last she would be in a
      position physically to destroy the objects that were the foci of
      the control. At the present she was more concerned with the array
      of lights woken on the dash, and the system messages on display
      screen.</p>

    <p>Long term considerations were relegated to the job queue as she
      fed power to the engines, and let the car lift from rest. Four
      minutes, she noted coldly as the car reached rooftop level, and she
      engaged forward thrust. She kept speed down to avoid being noticed
      by the aerial patrol, but as high as she dared. One minute of
      freedom was all she asked, in order to gain enough speed and
      altitude to make interception not worth the hassle.</p>

    <p>The light was uncertain, and deceived her eyes, yet she was
      reluctant to use any of the active sensors, for fear of premature
      detection, and arrest. Rooftops became planes of grey against
      irregular shapes of utter black, lighted plaques adrift in an
      otherwise empty universe too vast and distant for there to be any
      perspective, cold flames of torments as she strained for focus.
      Exhaustion fought to claim her for itself, as the reaction to the
      nervous strain.</p>

    <p>She didn't comprehend the ending of her punishment, that the
      last rooftop was behind her, until she saw the final barrier ahead.
      She turned her head; and indeed the last high stone wall was past.
      Below, grass grew, untamed and wiry, and she let the car descend to
      it. A hundred yards that stretched, before the world ended in
      cliffs, to a sea of gun-metal below their plunge.</p>

    <!-- div class="hide">
      <div style="padding:5px;border: black 1px solid;text-align: center;background-color: #eee;color:inherit">
        <img height="384" width="688" src="00633-431991831.png" />
        <p>Escape</p>
      </div>
    </div -->

    <p>Halfway there, a seam was cut in the land, as far to left and to
      right as her eyes could discern, a line where the dust boiled to
      waist height, where the pilot layers of the lift fields intersected
      the surface. As yet only at about fifty percent capacity, the rest
      not likely to be fully operative until five days hence, yet
      stretched to cover the same volume as the full network would
      handle, the cover that resulted was sloppy. The effect was smudged
      over a band a meter wide, or thereabouts, as far as she could
      judge. It made, thankfully, surreptitious passage &#8212; whether entry
      or exit &#8212; safer, though less comfortable.</p>

    <p>The time was 00:32, and she felt disinclined to waste any more
      of the last hundred some seconds on caution than were absolutely
      necessary. She eased power to the forward thrusters, and the car
      leapt forwards at her bidding, at what she hoped was a judiciously
      gauged acceleration, a compromise between fast and slow
      passage.</p>

    <p>The groundspeed indicator showed forty miles per hour when she
      hit the field, enough she judged, to hit the easiest passage. Too
      fast and the discomfort and potential for damage would be increase,
      too slow and she would remain needlessly long in the zone of
      hazard.</p>

    <p>She watched it coming up, and at the last moment, let go of the
      controls. The car passed through the veil, and a shock of ripping
      pain hit her, followed by the disquieting feeling that her mind had
      been pulled from its moorings and then allowed to snap back without
      any ado.</p>

    <p>The car rode out into the free night, rocking slightly as the
      autopilot compensated from the ripple of upthrust imparted to it,
      and out over the ocean, beginning a long slow dive.</p>

    <p>Nancy, recovering from the disorientation of the passage,
      unprotected, of the field took up the controls again, and looked
      around. Below her, under the heaving, distorted sheen of the sea,
      and the clash of foam lining the cliffs, on the platform at hundred
      foot depth that was the true sea-bottom, on which the Castle had
      landed, there were lights. Friend or foe, she could not tell &#8212;
      either an aid for underwater patrol by the cybersoldiers of the
      Clan, or the first preparations of an early arriving group of
      marine sentients &#8212; they would seem the same from her vantage point.
      She would notify the castle later, in case they were hostile, but
      that was after she had settled the immediate problem of leaving the
      neighbourhood.</p>

    <p>She pulled the wheel hard back with one hand, and with the
      other, advanced the thrusters to their fullest extent. Motors
      whined as power was fed to them, the airspeed and groundspeed
      monitors began a steady climb About her the sea and sky rotated, as
      the horizon fell out of the forwards view, and spun about a
      vertical axis, in a screaming turning climb for the thinnest of the
      local air traffic. Almost ahead, was a star, and she altered her
      course, centring it in the screen. The drives moaned as Nancy kept
      them on the edge of overload though the acceleration held her down
      into the seat. Let them think that she rode something with orbital
      capacity, if that would discourage initial pursuit. Orbital
      capacity would have been nice &#8212; would have cut her journey time
      from two hours to twenty minutes, but would have required her to
      register with the Guild and on open access files at that. Such
      disclosures would not exactly be politic &#8212; and nor would her new
      programming consent to that. Be content then, she thought, with
      something that gulps air as reaction mass.</p>

    <p>As she approached the car's ceiling, Nancy edged the climb into
      a grand arch, aimed the nose at the western fall of the rings, and
      locked the controls. Her business now was a little more inspired
      than moment to moment piloting &#8212; she would be a long while on the
      car's phone link. The proximity alarm would serve her against the
      approach of craft with hostile intent.</p>

    <p>The onboard processor and sensors had already locked into the
      closest overhead <a href="annot.html#RelayComsat">relay comsat</a>, and at the
      touch of a switch, a beam of near ultraviolet light reached up to
      it. On the screen a symbolic representation of the keyboard's
      numeric pad appeared, indicating that she should dial.</p>

    <p>Her first call was for the weather charts, both local and
      continental, all the way she would have to go, seeking a route that
      would give her maximum cloud cover to hide beneath, away from the
      prying eyes that orbited the planet masquerading as resource
      monitor platforms, or similar euphemisms; anything indeed that
      permitted or required the installation of high resolution cameras
      trained onto the world below.</p>

    <p>The final course she chose wove and tacked, taking every
      advantage of every last scrap of water vapour condensation existing
      or projected to exist on her arrival.</p>

    <p>That was number one. She committed the weather charts to store,
      and cleared the call. As soon as the keypad symbol showed, she
      punched in another number.</p>

    <p>The bell flashed on and on, when she had completed the code.
      Could he have chosen this night of all nights to be out? With the
      back of her mind she counted the flashes as they mounted into the
      twenties in number. Come on, Come on, she urged Answer it answer
      it. Snafu &#8212; why now, when so much was riding on it.</p>

    <p>And when she had almost despaired of hope, the screen lit up.
      Nancy drew a deep breath.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Evening, Auntie Shar.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Evening, Nancy. How come you're driving about now &#8212; it's after
      the twenty-four hours, isn't it?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Yeah, just I just didn't tell anyone I was going. Is Uncle Chan
      in?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;No, not at the moment he's at dinner with some of his
      students.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;When'll he be back?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Half an hour or so. Can I take a message for him?&#8221;</p>

    <p>Nancy hesitated a moment &#8212; what could she say.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she eventually decided, &#8220;Tell him I'll call again at 19:15
      your time, and that it's important I won't say more &#8212; I don't
      really trust the line.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I will. Is that all?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I think so, at least that's all I can think of in the way of
      business&#8230;but there's not any interesting gossip.
      Everything's politics, these days. I'll sign off, I suppose. I want
      to stay loose. See you.&#8221;</p>

    <p>She broke the connection, and powered down the communications
      laser.</p>

    <p>Now in the privacy of the car, she felt free to swear, and did
      so, albeit monotonously, for the next few minutes.</p>

    <p>Though the delay was not yet crucial, she couldn't go ahead with
      any other preparations for the evening's business.</p>

    <p>She tuned into a news channel of the Tree-V network. Expectedly,
      she caught a running commentary on the situation she had left
      behind.</p>

    <p>They were presently showing a live picture, obviously taken with
      high resolution cameras from several miles away, of the Castle
      Wolf, with commentary from the being on the spot.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Here at Castle Wolf, which must surely be the most famous and
      controversial of the Clans, the situation is much as at the other
      locations. Nothing has changed, now the deadline has expired, the
      internal watch of cybersoldiers is still at its original strength,
      although we have no idea as to how many more have been mobilized
      inside its walls. Just a reminder to those of you who have only
      just tuned in, the deadline for the vacation order expired five
      minutes ago, and we're showing a replay of the serving of that
      order on channel 162 if you're interested in seeing history in the
      making.</p>

    <p>&#8220;One event here that broke the monotony of the last few minutes
      occurred only a few seconds before the deadline. A vehicle took off
      from the castle, heading slightly south of west as it climbed. It's
      below our horizon at the moment but from the way it was flying,
      it's my guess that it was an orbital craft, probably heading for
      the Snowflake.</p>

    <p>&#8220;We'll give you confirmation on that when we hear. Back on the
      ground, however, as you can see, some cars are landing near the
      castle. From interviews we carried out on the radio earlier today,
      it seems that these will be peaceful protesters in the main but a
      few cars declined to answer us. This is Kerry Qorwen, handing you
      back to the studio.&#8221;</p>

    <p>In the studio, the commentator sat in a plush armchair, in front
      of a map of the western half of the continent of Embrys, in
      featureless green, against a featureless blue of ocean. Five
      chesspiece castles, in a nearly regular pentagonal array, showed in
      red. One of the two coastal ones, the northernmost, flashed slowly.
      That was where Nancy's home was.</p>

    <p>The commentator, avian, tall and slender, reacted slowly to the
      change of scene.</p>

    <p>&#8220;And that was one of our live coverage units, he announced after
      a few seconds had passed. As you can see, the Clans are taking
      tonight's events rather casually &#8212; as I suppose they well might.
      However it might be to us, we must remember that for the Clans Wolf
      and Connors, this will be the seventh time that they have been
      expelled from a world that they tried to claim as their own.</p>

    <p>&#8220;On the more strategic level we can say that the vehicle seen
      leaving the Castle has not gone into orbit, but has remained at an
      altitude consistent with it being a standard aircar. Further there
      has been no flight plan lodged with the Guild. We have not yet
      identified the pilot, but we would conjecture that it was one of
      the Clan fleeing for the Guild port at High Prospect.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Meanwhile the sporadic bombardment to which the Castles have
      been subjected is intensifying, now that they have been finally
      declared beyond the law. We have contacted the Linkers' Guild on
      the question of the legality of the use of high trajectory
      bombardment of this sort, and it appears that the shells do not
      exceed the fifty mile altitude that defines the edge of space.</p>

    <p>&#8220;On the political front, the talks began early today between the
      Council, and the representatives of the <a href="annot.html#FreeTraders">Free Traders'</a> League, to
      renegotiate the status of Westfield Port, and the League itself
      under the treaty of Foundation. Comment has surrounded the
      appearance at the preliminary talks between the Ministers concerned
      and Trader captains who are in port &#8212; and that makes about all of
      the captains who make a regular run here, the
      appearance of Esseval Kingarra of StarLine and Vors k'Shammarra of
      Shammarra Funding. Informed opinion inclines towards their
      appearance being primarily ostentation, for although they are not
      directly party to the negotiations, they own large interests in the
      fleet that operates through Wyvern, and it is assumed that they
      will act as advisors to the Trader captains. At this juncture, it
      may be interesting to note that the Linkers' Guild seem to have
      waived their right to have an observer on the committee. No-one
      that we have spoken to seems to know whether this action was an
      oversight or intended as a deliberate snub, and the Guild
      themselves have declined to comment.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Other relevant business in the council, today, went on despite
      the depleted numbers, and the primary measures under debate were
      concerned with the status of various activities against, the clans
      over the last months. There is a growing movement to quash the
      sentences imposed upon many people under the Public Order Acts, for
      activities against the Clans during the last few months. This
      position is interesting, as the precise wording of the acts
      involved, and the Foundational principles they invoke are
      comparatively involved. Remembering that these laws were all
      composed by the late Lady Aelia Min-Ko&euml; and the rest of the
      Board of Directors of the Five Castles, we can see that the legal
      wrangling may go on for quite a while yet.</p>

    <p>&#8220;As there seems to be little action at any of the castle sites at
      the moment, let's go over to Krsss Namell for a review of the
      historical perspective of the problem.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Nancy switched off the program. She had no real wish for another
      history of the problem, with authentic anti-Clan bias thrown in.
      She was annoyed enough by being one of the prime stories of the
      evening. At least her phone conversation hadn't been broadcast to
      the waiting millions &#8212; and they had in her ignorance misjudged her
      immediate goal. It would seem now that she would in all earnest
      need the guard platoons she had asked Tricia for.</p>

    <p>There were over twenty-five minutes left until the time she had
      specified for calling Uncle Chan, and still no cloud cover for
      hundreds of miles. She set the car into a long and very shallow
      dive, that would bring her down below the cloud deck when, hundreds
      of miles ahead, she encountered the first cloud.</p>

    <p>She watched the time tick slowly by, with mounting anxiety, as
      she rehearsed the lines she would say, polishing a phrase here,
      deleting one there, scrapping them, and starting again, and all the
      while, stage fright threatened to overtake her before the crawling
      seconds expired. Silently the figures flowed, shape into shape,
      green on black.</p>

    <p>Nancy never looked up, never exposing her face to the orbiting
      eyes, anxious to remain out of the public gaze, hide what last
      vestige of privacy remained to her. She was crouched over the
      clock, entranced by it, as if in prayer or meditation.</p>

    <p>The time appointed came, and was past, before Nancy realized.
      Witch actions clumsy though haste, she switched on the laser and
      dialled.</p>

    <p>The screen belled twice, before lighting up, to show Chan, now
      returned.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Hello, Nancy. What's up?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Everything, absolutely everything. Uncle Chan, do you swear on
      your House that you'll help me, even though I sound mad?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Daughter, do you realize what it means for a <a href="annot.html#HanChiaki">Han-Chiaki</a> to swear on his
      House?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I think so, my Uncle. It means that you hold your life, the
      freedom of your dependents and their descendents and your honour
      forfeit to me if you break the oath, and that in that case, your
      name will be erased from the Tower of Record.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Aye. That is essentially it. Now what do you wish me to swear?
      I'll accept public records as suitable for the transaction.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I want you to swear that you will help me as I ask or at least
      offer me no hindrance in what I must do, regardless of what danger
      I expose myself to.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I have that recorded. I, Chan as'Korran of the third line of the
      Great House of Tarnweft swear on my honour and my House to follow
      that command of the Lady Nancy Elanor of Wolf. Now what sort of
      help do you want?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I want you to get the keys to your museum, the files of records,
      a small arsenal of non-powered weaponry, and a telepath.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;What are you planning to do?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I don't know &#8212; it all depends what the telepath can do. I could
      give you a few guesses, but they're wild, and I don't really trust
      this line. I promise under my honour to tell you everything when I
      arrive. Please have everything ready then. Believe me, I wouldn't
      be doing this if I had any choice in the matter. I'm bound as much
      as you are, or probably more so.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Don't worry, Nancy, everything will be all right. It'll all be
      ready for you when you arrive.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Thanks, Uncle Chan, thanks awfully. I'll be there in about an
      hour and a half. See you then.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;See you too, Nancy.&#8221;</p>

    <p>She broke, the connection first, and began to dial again. While
      the screen rang, she picked up a cloth and covered the camera lens
      at her end.</p>

    <p>Answer came almost at once, this time, and Nancy spoke quickly,
      before there could be any acknowledgment of the connection.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Alan, this is Honey McLain. This is important &#8212; are you
      alone?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Yes, but&#8230;&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;May I check that with your in-house systems?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Be my guest.&#8221;</p>

    <p>She saw him key in the appropriate command. Part of the screen
      blanked to show the readouts. He was indeed alone.</p>

    <p>Nancy removed the cloth.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Sorry about that, but I had to make sure. I may have to drop by
      later this evening. Will you hide me if I do? I promise that I'll
      only do that if I'm sure I'll lose any pursuit.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;OK. Nancy, one thing &#8212; are you the car that was on the news
      earlier?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Yes. Do you want to change your mind?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;How do I know? Remember, I want to stay nicely neutral 'cause I
      happen to like being alive. If you don't draw the heat, it's
      okay.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Thanks, Alan.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Thank you, my Lady.&#8221;</p>

    <p>That was, she reflected, not a nice thing to do to a poor guy
      like that. She could mould him to her whim And she had done, and he
      wouldn't bring himself to refuse her. Even if she now told him to
      forget it, he would not &#8212; he seemed to enjoy the role of gentleman
      too much, and having beguiled her knight, she was likely to wreck
      him as much as she had in her turn been wrecked.</p>

    <p>Even war would be cleaner than the sickness on the world now,
      and the taint of it was on her. She thought longingly of escape.
      The Guild port was comparatively close, on the scale of travel she
      was working with, to the University. She tried to reset the course,
      to get herself lifted away from this prison world, but her demon
      and her honour were agreed on the matter. To run would solve
      nothing, would leave her incomplete, still tied to Wyvern, and
      unable to return. Even the Partnership of Worlds was finite, and
      far too small to sustain her for a lifetime's running. There was no
      course open to her other than to see this thing through or die in
      the attempt. Only afterwards would she be free to wash her hands of
      the whole sordid affair, and depart in peace.</p>

    <p>She looked out on the deceptive peace that surrounded her, at
      the rings rising from the ocean, soaring up, and over her head,
      like a support for the dome of night. Their reflection was a path
      of cold metal on the water, from archfoot to archfoot across the
      palely phosphorescent ocean, a cold and delicate blue at the
      breaking of the waves.</p>

    <p>Ten miles below, the scattered coral islands that dotted the
      waters showed themselves as occasional anomalies in the pattern of
      light and dark. Any of them could hide a force sufficient to
      capture her, and the smallest rock house a missile launcher
      sufficient to destroy her. In a craft not built for combat, she
      could rely only on what element of surprise was still with her, and
      enemy inactivity.</p>

    <p>Everything she had planned seemed to be working, so now she
      could only wait. Her home was already twenty five hundred miles
      behind, and she was not yet half way to her rendezvous. She was
      alone in the distance and the dark, with only the dark things in
      her mind for company, and with nothing to occupy the time that she
      could devote her concentration to. There would be entertainment
      broadcasts, but she felt unwilling to make the effort to follow a
      storyline, and any news channel would be pouring out much the same
      material as she had heard earlier, which was not really
      entertaining even when viewed with a sick sense of humour.</p>

    <p>Her consciousness seethed with a mass of conflicting thoughts,
      half verbalized, half feelings, painful things that she would
      rather not think about. Regrets, that she had turned down Tricia's
      offer of company, that she had not refused to take part in any of
      the violence of the past months, that she had gone to the museum,
      by that route and to that floor, that she had gotten into the
      situations that had led her inexorably to this, and for other
      things, smaller, more private, friends slighted and crazy boasts.
      Fears, for her own safety, for the success of this hare-brained
      venture she had committed herself to, for family and friends, and
      fears of the things that had ensnared her mind and called her to
      their bidding. Faint, and half lost, her secret hopes for the
      future, and her cynical projections of the same.</p>

    <p>The wind whistled faintly about the car as it tore through the
      upper troposphere at four times the speed of sound, quiet in the
      relative calm behind the bowshock. In the otherwise silent ear, the
      wind and the motor hum were all that Nancy had to listen to, and
      she listened intently to the sound.</p>

    <p>In that rush of wind music, her mind pieced together from faint
      cues, and forgotten memories, the banshee wailing that she had
      heard less than two days before, the sound she had heard when she
      had dared to strike the blivit, that dark midnight so recently
      past. The sound hovered, menacingly, at the bounds of perception,
      like a demon wolf held at bay by the light of a camp fire, working
      on her fears through its own ghostly presence and its darkly hinted
      potential for what she could only term evil.</p>

    <p>She shivered, uneasy now, feeling a sense of presence outside
      the car, a malignance that might reach in and take her, a force
      with more definite aims than the one that had already entered her
      mind. She wanted to hide herself away from it, but there was little
      she could do. There were no bedclothes to pull over her head and
      cower under nor yet any source of spiritual solace for her to draw
      on, and turn against the threat All that was left her was the
      capacity to opaque the, dome, and turn the lights on bright, to
      banish the night, and loud music to mask the sound of the outside,
      and so to fool herself that they were gone away. Sleep without
      dreams tempted her, but always sleep meant dreams as real to her as
      life, and she didn't care for the dreams that she might have that
      night. Drugs would serve to get rid of that, but they would also
      prevent her from taking the controls at an instant's notice.</p>

    <p>The only other relevant drugs in the car's aid kit were
      combat-hysteria inducing and she was reluctant to do further
      mischief to her mind. There was really little alternative to
      sitting, and losing herself in the music until the time came to do
      something; and meanwhile the minutes and the miles rolled slowly
      past her.</p>

    <p>Thirty minutes past one. An hour out from the castle; an hour
      from the University, and she was still over the wide, and open
      ocean, and only slightly over half the way to the further shore.
      There were no islands now, only the rolling topography of the
      abyssal plain, three miles and more beneath the silver of the sea.
      Even the sky was empty, from horizon to horizon no traffic opened
      itself to the navigational sensors.</p>

    <p>Now, if she lacked friends, it was also sure that she lacked
      enemies, her only companions on the voyage, the fish of the ocean
      and the birds of the wide seas far below her course. That thought
      appealed to her and seemed to calm her though it was a drained and
      hollow calm. She killed the music, and let the wind take up that
      emotion, work its variations on it, like an escort of lost souls,
      and its emptiness removed the threat.</p>

    <p>She let the windows become transparent. The world, the rings,
      the sea, were all still there. High in the West, her guide star
      hung; a finger's width from the rings, the Snowflake served as a
      beacon for her journey.</p>

    <p>A star detached itself from the firmament ahead brightening from
      obscurity to low negative magnitudes as she watched, swinging away
      to the left, and down, until it was below her, and lost to sight, a
      piece of the rings now fallen to earth. Running into massive stones
      like that was an accepted hazard of high altitude flight in low
      latitudes but it was the first time that she had seen a bolide from
      above. A few words from a half remembered song passed through her
      mind, something about shooting stars, but it was lost in the hollow
      crescendo of the wind.</p>

    <p>Nancy shrugged. The song could be remembered some other time.
      For the moment, the night, the journey, the loneliness, they were
      all she needed.</p>
