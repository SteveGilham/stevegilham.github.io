    <p>It was night-time, and probably well past midnight, and she was
      all alone. Above her, Dean's Tower thrust like an obscene mushroom
      into the sky, its windows leering, emptily at her. Pursuit was
      close behind her, and her vulnerability was something almost
      physical enough to be felt.</p>

    <p>She was running, so the passing buildings blurred into formless
      masses of grey and black. There was no time, no need to concentrate
      on that inflow of information &#8212; her subconscious could sample what
      it needed to keep her from stumbling. The next sight she
      consciously noted was indoors. She now ran along a corridor that
      seemed to stretch forever both ahead of her and behind her, but she
      had no conscious memory of ever entering a building.</p>

    <p>In the blind panic that had caught her up, she had chosen a
      route that could quite easily kill her &#8212; if she couldn't get out of
      the far end before her pursuers entered the corridor she might as
      well stop and blow her own brains out.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Nancy!&#8221; Ahead of her, a figure beckoned from the doorway at the
      end of the passage.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Astrid &#8212; what are you doing here?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Come on! Hurry!&#8221; That seemed enough answer to Nancy &#8212; elaborate
      conversation could await a somewhat safer venue. She followed her
      leader through the doorway.</p>

    <p>She halted there awhile, alone. About her, the plain stretched
      in all directions to the distant horizon, the grass waving and
      tufted, like a silvery ocean in the light of the rings. Above her,
      the sky was a complete hemisphere of black, without shading or
      feature.</p>

    <p>From nowhere, a wind came, and rustled the grass until it
      sounded like breathing, and a muttering of conversation. She
      strained to catch meaning in the talk, but it eluded her.</p>

    <p>Ahead, and slightly to her left, was the sole feature of that
      barren landscape, a stand of trees, about fifty feet across, and
      dark in the harsh, merciless grey light. It was, she knew, where
      she must go.</p>

    <p>She walked forwards cautiously, then faster. The grass was like
      mist about her feet, and the ground firm and level. As she
      approached the trees, the grass thinned, and a path appeared, worn
      by the passage of feet over the years, and she followed its lead,
      and called sword to her hand. The blade burned with a cold and
      malevolent flame, like a captive moonbeam.</p>

    <p>The trees were about her now, lining a path, long and straight,
      to the heart of the place. They arrayed themselves as a guard of
      honour along the route, and spread their branches above her head
      like fan vaulting, a cathedral in ebony and argent. Small splashes
      of light fell onto the path. It was dust, dead and dry.</p>

    <!-- div class="hide">
        <div style="padding:5px;border: black 1px solid;text-align: center;background-color: #eee;color:inherit">

          <p>In the forests of the night</p>
        </div>
      </div -->

    <p>A hundred yards away, or thereabouts, a light showed at the end
      of the tunnel. It grew as Nancy moved towards it, seeming to drift
      through unreality, until she stepped out into a vast clearing
      amongst the trees, where short grass grew. In its middle, this
      expanse sprouted a spiral pattern of standing stones, that reached
      inwards to some centre of power, hidden by the uncertain light.</p>

    <p>Nancy's flesh prickled to the feel of an interplay of unknowable
      energies. There was a heavy aromatic smell, pleasant but
      nauseating, drifting on the wind. It passed and all be came still.
      Involuntarily, she shivered.</p>

    <p>With reluctance, she stepped forwards, to enter the vortex,
      knowing that it was the only course of action open to her. In
      following it, she might gain her unknown goal, or she might
      encounter and succumb to the powers in there with power enough to
      destroy her, and more. To stay behind was folly, especially with
      pursuit so close behind&#8230;</p>

    <p>From the outside, it had seemed that the ashen skylight fell as
      brightly within the compass of the stones as outside them, but on
      passing the first stone, Nancy had stepped into darkness. Yet if
      the light from beyond did not reach her, that did not mean that the
      dark was absolute. Rather the path and the stones flickered with
      potassium purple flame, and between and beyond them, small disks of
      light, always in pairs, blank and either red or yellow, that first
      appeared and then vanished again.</p>

    <p>Fear attacked her, suffocating her, and clamping her heart in a
      grip of ice. She could see no shapes, but without doubt, those
      lights were eyes, and on that cue, the adrenaline had been loosed
      into her system. Her hands tightened on her gun as if it were a
      talisman of power against all the evil in the universe. Detachedly
      she felt amusement. Ask her on an open street in broad daylight
      about evil, and she would deny that the word had semantic value,
      yet now she could sense it as plainly as she could see the
      stones.</p>

    <p>With quiet inevitability, she moved to the heart of the
      manifestation, and with every step, she could feel strength flowing
      from her. A heaviness, like shackles of black velvet, weighed her
      down; sight constricted to a narrow cone, as if she looked the
      wrong way down a telescope, and around it the colours behind her
      eyelids played like fireworks gone mad. The violet fire grew and
      caught at her ankles.</p>

    <p>She fired her gun wildly, hosing, its blue fire about her as if
      it were water. The pale tongues of purple drank it quietly, and did
      not seem to change, though its clutch seemed to weaken slightly.
      There was no thought of turning; her footsteps slowly led inwards,
      and as she went, the higher the clinging flames rose, the slower
      and more infrequent her strides became.</p>

    <p>One turn from the centre, the leaping violet tongues were at her
      throat, she had almost ceased to move. She felt torn apart, as if
      she was dissolving slowly in that fluid. Even to breathe was now an
      effort. The culmination was now close; a wave of flame that finally
      submerged her rolled around the curve and at her.</p>

    <p>She had no time to feel fear, only surprise that she remained,
      and now but a discorporate viewpoint, seemingly free from all
      restraint. She turned, and caught a fleeting glimpse of something
      lost in flame, before its shape went, and the fires collapsed into
      the formless carpet of their origin. She did not name to herself
      what was she had seen.</p>

    <p>Now loosed, her movement into the vortex was no longer hindered
      &#8212; instead she was drawn almost irresistibly towards the centre.
      Without any other choice of action, she surrendered herself to the
      steady drift towards the central nexus.</p>

    <p>The force ceased, as suddenly as it began, at the edge of the
      central arena. In the centre of that void, some thirty feet across,
      a circular platform of white marble streaked with grey floated. It
      was lit in white light, as if by spotlight, in contrast with the
      purple glows beyond. A perfect disk of polished stone, six feet
      across, it was a contrast with the rough blocky pillars of the
      way.</p>

    <p>Upon it stood something to make her hackles rise. It was her own
      form, save that the silvery hair was waist length; far more than
      she herself had ever bothered to grow, and on the brow, proud and
      imperial, she wore the silver and adamant crown of Wolf. An
      incongruous wave of lust rippled through her consciousness, turning
      to revulsion as she saw the alien necklet burning blue at her
      throat.</p>

    <p>The husk stretched forth imploring arms.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Join me, come to me. We are one, we need to be together. Please
      do not stay apart. Think of your needs&#8230;&#8221;</p>

    <p>The tongue spoken was not <a href="annot.html#Tweenspeak">Tweenspeak</a>, but something
      alien, and yet she understood it, and instinctively rebelled
      against it, fighting to be out. She tried to scream when she found
      that she could not resist the allure, but even voice failed her
      now. She could only struggle helplessly as she was drawn towards
      the silver witch who wore her body.</p>

    <hr />
    <p>She woke, and knew that it had only been a dream &#8212; or was &#8216;only&#8217;
      really the right word to use? She had dreamed that same dream,
      event for event, detail for detail, only the night before She could
      only remember one possible instance of another dream recurring, and
      enough time had elapsed between and since for memories to become
      garbled by lying dormant.</p>

    <p>To dream twice the same dream, on consecutive nights, a dream
      with far more solidity and coherence in its imagery than her normal
      dreams was unlikely. That in both instances she should notice the
      alien artifact, yet had only found out its true form between the
      episodes put it all beyond the reach of unaided probability.</p>

    <p>On the first time, she now recalled, when the viewpoint had
      reached the centre of the stones, she had not been drawn inwards,
      but instead gone on to some other, more friendly theme of unreality
      &#8212; something about the castle, she recalled, or possibly the
      University, or possibly some weird fusion of the two. The second
      time was different &#8212; she had allowed the thing entry to her mind
      for a second time, and even if she had won the battle during the
      day, she had lost the day's campaigning, and it kicked a gut
      reaction into life, a quiet nausea, a hollowness.</p>

    <p>Last night, she had not woken, but now she was wide awake, and
      despite a faint kamikaze regret at not having seen the dream
      through to its conclusion, she was glad of that.</p>

    <!-- div class="hide">

        </div>
      </div -->

    <p>She opened her eyes. The grey light that softly illuminated the
      room showed the first hints of dawn, and she twisted around until
      she could see a clock. In pale green figures, distorted by the
      angle at which she viewed them, it announced that the time was now
      04:12, and as she watched, the minutes figure advanced one
      step.</p>

    <p>Carefully, trying not to lose her balance in the gloom, Nancy
      stood up. Through the window, she could see out to the arch of the
      rings cutting across an almost clear sky. Few stars were visible in
      the washed out heavens, that already paled towards the east, but a
      couple of the other planets of the system showed as brightly
      unwinking points. She picked up her dress from where she had
      discarded it, and pulled it on, and gathered up her boots.</p>

    <p>The room around her was littered with the dark shapes of people
      asleep, and the sounds of breathing. and snoring formed a backdrop
      that she had heard even in her dream, yet which seemed to fade from
      conscious perception by virtue of its familiarity.</p>

    <p>She shuffled forwards, lightly on her bare feet, until she could
      touch the edge of the work surface that ran along one wall, and
      then with that as her guide, moved towards the door, delicately
      stepping over the bodies. On the shelf, at the foot of a mural
      depicting a hunting scene, a girl lay, limbs asprawl, deeply and
      quietly slumbering. Her face was non-human &#8212; feline in its
      inspiration. Its half seen form, a hunter's face in repose,
      imprinted itself sharply in Nancy's mind, recalling, the gem that
      now snared her mind.</p>

    <p>She paused a few moments in the hallway to clear the disturbing
      image from her mind. Across the way from her, light spilled out
      from under a door, igniting the carpet to a fiery red glow. There
      was the sound of voices, and faint music. She entered the room, and
      all conversations ceased. For a few moments no one moved, with
      everyone staring at Nancy and Nancy doing her best to return the
      compliment.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Nancy,&#8221; one of the girls remarked, &#8220;you're grey!&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Yeah &#8212; so what.&#8221; Pause. &#8220;Oh my God.&#8221;</p>

    <p>She let her voice trail away into silence &#8212; she had noticed the
      bare flesh of her arm. No longer pinkish brown it was a normal,
      healthy, mid-grey, save where she had been wounded the previous
      night. There, stretched beyond its repetoire of imitative
      adaptation, the quasiflesh patching was a cancer of pinkish grey,
      obscene and sickening. The sudden seeming change left her feeling
      dizzy.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I didn't know you were Change-immune. Were you told about
      this?&#8221;</p>

    <p>The speaker was a young man wearing a clan Brady armband.</p>

    <p>&#8220;No &#8212; I didn't even realize such a thing was possible.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Its rare &#8212; Change is just a tailored gene-cancer virus &#8212; some
      people are just lucky enough to be immune to it or can develop
      immunity. Would have been useful fifteen hundred years ago. As is,
      it's a nuisance, but usually masked by stronger patterns.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Oh damn the technicalities. What am I going to do now? We can't
      stay here all day, can we?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Not really &#8212; if you were seen here like this&#8230; You can't
      really hide in a set like this. Any ideas?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Go back to my room &#8212; I've still got some of the old Asrovene
      outfits we wore last term &#8212; get me behind a mask and then stay
      loose, I suppose. I only need to be in my room to pack, and that
      won't take long. We'll be getting a lift out at 10:00 anyway, but
      it's those hours when people are up and about&#8230; Any better
      suggestions?&#8221;</p>

    <p>No-one ventured anything.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Okay,&#8221; Nancy decided, &#8220;Wait until its light enough to see by
      outside and then we can go Now who is there here who hardly goes to
      Greenhollow &#8212; The less familiar any faces are, the better.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I'll go.&#8221; It was the young man of Clan Brady who volunteered
      first, and he was joined by one of the Min-Ko&euml; girls.</p>

    <p>While they waited for the light to improve, the team
      breakfasted, and when they returned from the kitchen, they found
      that someone had turned the radio on to a news channel.</p>

    <p>&#8220;&#8230;and locally, the main item of news is the arrival in High
      Prospect of the regional director of the StarLine shipping concern,
      along with Vors k'Shamarra, the president of the Shamarra Funding
      Cartel to join in talks with representatives of the Free Traders
      League and senior government ministers.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Although no statement has been issued, it is widely understood
      that these talks are a forerunner to a renegotiation of the
      relative position of the Linkers' Guild and the Free Traders and
      the Treaty of Foundation, following the demise, in yesterday's
      sitting, of the Five Castles regime.</p>

    <p>&#8220;For a fuller analysis of the situation, we hand you now over
      to&#8230;&#8221; A switch clicked, and the voice was stilled.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Ho hum!&#8221; someone commented, with mock levity, &#8220;The ink's hardly dry
      on their last little game, and they start selling the planet to the
      highest bidder &#8212; and people actually voted for them&#8230;&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;But think of the money,&#8221; it was suggested.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Crap &#8212; who needs money &#8212; it's power they're after, and they're
      too damn na&iuml;ve to realize that they're selling themselves down
      the river. I'd like to see the expression on&#8230; what's his
      name &#8212; the guy in the Populist party, Edvarton &#8212; when he finds out
      he's only one grade up from teaboy (Junior, Third class) in
      Shammara Funding or StarLine. If only they would show some decent,
      civilized apathy&#8230;&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;And one more time&#8230;&#8221; Nancy's comment was edged with enough
      sarcasm to be bitchy, &#8220;I am sick and bloody tired of that same old
      moan about politicians who don't have two brain cells to rub
      together, only an undernourished self interest, it's too much like
      descending to their level.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Okay, Okay, I know! But, hell, it makes you sick when supposedly
      responsible people do absolutely loopy things for supposedly
      altruistic motives. If that's government, I'd rather see
      anarchy.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Nancy looked out of the window &#8212; fortunately, it seemed to be
      light enough, outside, and glad to get out of a rapidly developing,
      debate on political theory, suggested that a move be made.</p>

    <hr />
    <p>It was indeed brighter now, the few stars and planets that had
      been visible were gone as the sky had paled, and on the eastern
      horizon the first tinges of the dawn provided a faint colouring to
      the scene. In the open, there was almost enough light for Nancy's
      colour vision, making the green of foliage truly green, and not a
      peculiar type of grey.</p>

    <p>They had decided to strike across country, firstly deciding that
      if the roads were being watched, the extra speed could do them no
      good anyway, compared with the scant likelihood of being spotted in
      the rough, and secondly that it was as good a way as any to kill
      time that would be hanging heavily on their hands that morning.
      Fortunately, the course their would take meant that they would not
      have to cross the river. Though a generous bend in its course put
      the river across the direct path, both colleges were on the same
      side of its valley, and the extra half mile of detour would save
      them the bother of being out under open skies, or crossing, a
      river, or killing another ten or twenty minutes.</p>

    <p>The college was as a city deserted. There was no traffic on the
      pathways, no loiterers in the empty courts. In all the windows, the
      glass was opaqued, showing, a pearly silver now that there was no
      light inside the rooms.</p>

    <p>In the woods, however, beyond the arbitrary boundary of taming,
      night still held sway, and once out of sight of the borders of its
      shaded domain, the three paused to let their eyes adapt to the
      gloom, and when they could again see clearly to avoid pitfalls in
      the broken terrain, they moved on. The forest floor about them was
      carpeted in flowers predominantly pale lilac, with here and there a
      patch of pink, or of yellow, or more rarely, blue. In places, the
      efflorescence was so dense and full that they could not avoid
      walking on it, and crushing the flowers underfoot.</p>

    <p>The trees around them were gnarled and old, and closely packed,
      and heavily leaved. Even at noon, though thirty feet above them
      might experience glaring sunlight, here a green cool dusk would
      hide. Yet, as they walked, and the ground sloped upwards as they
      gradually moved away from the river, striking south to avoid its
      curve, the texture of the woods changed. Slowly, while the soil
      beneath their feet changed in quality, the woods opened out, and
      the trees became taller, sixty to eighty feet tall. Here the leaf
      canopy, though about as dense as it had been, was made up of
      layers, each individually thinner, and occasionally large patches
      of blue sky could be seen. About them, visibility extended fifty or
      more yards, showing the local topography. There were puddles still
      from the previous night's rain, trapped in hollows in the clay
      soil, and everywhere the autumn's leaves carpeted the ground in
      oranges and yellows.</p>

    <p>High above them, in the trees, lizards sang. Any other wildlife
      seemed to be content to remain both silent and out of sight, all
      save one slink. It had draped its tawny body across a branch, and
      slept there as they passed under it. At their approach, it lifted
      its feline head, and opened one golden eye. It considered them as
      they passed, its gaze following them intently, then hesitated. It
      seemed to pause a few moments in thought, deciding whether it was
      worth bothering to hiss at them, or whether it might be more
      stylish just to ignore the intruders into its domain with a regal
      contempt. Eventually it decided that it would close its eyes, and
      go back to sleep.</p>

    <p>Nancy and her two companions, for their part, pressed on,
      through yet another mood of afforestation, where all the trees had
      sprouted clusters of thin trunks, to form a shoddy leaf cover, of
      leaves the size of thumbprints, at four inch intervals on thin
      twigs that themselves provided more cover. A few branches
      obstructed their way, with tangles of lesser twigs and a few vines
      for good measure, but they all broke brittlely at the slightest
      touch. They seemed dead and dying, here on this carpet of the
      leafgold of their own coining, and it depressed Nancy. She hurried,
      jogging through the rustling carpet of leaves and snapping twigs,
      with her guards following close behind.</p>

    <p>She was glad to begin the descent to a small tributary of the
      Greywater, where taller live trees grew, and brambles and small
      succulents, and patches of grass coloured the floor with patches of
      green. Her running had faltered to a walk, but as the slope, became
      noticeable, and she began to recognize the countryside around her,
      she hastened once again, down to the brook.</p>

    <p>It was on a tree stump near the stream that she was sitting,
      when her companions again caught her up. The waters babbled
      quietly, and above the gravelly bed, small creatures darted back
      and forth, carried by the flow. A few yards upstream, a log had
      been thrown across the channel as a bridge.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Nearly there,&#8221; she called softly as the two approached.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Just over the rise, that's where my room is &#8212; and I suppose
      that's where we'll part company. No point in being seen together.
      Just keep me in cover until I'm inside.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Okay by us. We'll spread out now, cover you from either
      side.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Right on. Call on me when sanity is resumed.&#8221;</p>

    <p>But there was no incident, no shoot-out, as Nancy reached the
      crest of the rise, and saw her own chalet. She saluted the two who
      had accompanied her, and then set off down the last fifty yards.
      The door opened to the <a href="annot.html#InfraRedSignal">coded
        infrared signal from her key ring</a>, and she closed it again behind her.</p>

    <p>Home again. It was so incredibly mundane that she could hardly
      believe the events of the previous two days. Here she could believe
      that life went on as before, and paranoia was a disease rather than
      an asset. The morning was bright, and soon, the sun would rise. It
      seemed such a pity to waste those precious moments of peace in just
      packing her belongings.</p>

    <hr />
    <p>It took her less than an hour. The sun could still be described
      as newly risen, and yet the last items had been stacked away, ready
      for her to pick up her suitcase, and go, all save a bundle of
      clothes lying on the bed, an outfit in the style worn by the
      Asroven. The Asroven were a desert people, from a small world, with
      pronounced axial tilt, and they had evolved from a small fox-like
      creature. Life had always migrated from hemisphere to hemisphere
      with the seasons, from small sea to small sea across the merciless
      deserts, and its people had become nomads, for fifty thousand years
      of recorded culture. Released from the cycle of the seasons by
      off-world contact, they had built cities that were more than
      semi-permanent trading posts, and had exploded out into the galaxy,
      retaining their distinctive style of dress, reminiscent of the Arab
      burnoose.</p>

    <p>Nancy packed her dress, and pulled on baggy pantaloons, tucking
      them into her boots, and took up the long-sleeved cloak, and the
      shimmering leather gauntlets, tying the hood under her chin. A
      silver mask of elaborate workmanship, depicting a sharp, vulpine
      face remained on the bed. The eyes were wide, and filled with
      golden sparkling iris, with horizontal slit pupils, though from the
      other side, they appeared smokily transparent. Nancy took up the
      mask, and standing in front of the mirror, attached it to the
      fastenings inside the hood. Now to the casual observer, she would
      seem to be a totally unremarkable figure, a sight seen every day,
      and even a careful observer could only distinguish her from the
      real thing by noticing that she lacked the barrel chest of the
      Asroven, developed to suck in the thin air of their world.</p>

    <!-- div class="hide">

        <p>Dressing up</p>
      </div>
    </div -->

    <p>Alone and unobserved, at least according to the sensors she had
      deployed around her rooms, she departed, with the intent of killing
      time until her transport arrived.</p>

    <p>She was nearly at the slideway before she realized that she was
      retracing the path she had walked that evening with Alan. The
      thought of him troubled her &#8212; he was almost kindred spirit, but not
      quite &#8212; they could share a bond of sympathy, but would rather be
      alone. On a whim, she decided to call on him, and say how she had
      deceived him.</p>

    <hr />
    <p>The slideway was a band of burning ice under her feet, deep as
      the unmelting polar snows, its blue with hints of darker and deeper
      tones below, and covered in turn by smoky trails of white, and it
      carried her on, while the wild wind of her passage whipped the
      cloak she wore, and tugged at her trousers. Its touch was chill
      despite the bright and unchecked sunlight and caressed the bare
      skin under the garb with icy fingers.</p>

    <p>Yet despite that minor discomfort, she was disappointed when
      finally she coasted to a halt on the big rink at Harkvale centre
      and took a few unsteady steps onto the stability of the concrete
      border, and then with confidant strides, set out along the path to
      Alan's chalet.</p>

    <p>The small house was made to much the same design as her own,
      with but minor stylistic, differences to distinguish them, and it
      was with a feeling of familiarity that she beamed her identifier
      signal at the door sensor.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Alan is asleep right now,&#8221; came the automated reply, &#8220;but he is
      only sleeping lightly and not dreaming. If you don't wish to
      disturb him, leave a message.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Could you wake him for me &#8212; it's important.&#8221; She was determined
      to go through with this thing, now she had decided it. The computer
      system acknowledged her demand, and then was silent.</p>

    <p>There was a long pause, and then, after perhaps two, three
      minutes, Alan appeared, unshaven, and wearing only his
      trousers.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Honey? he asked what are you doing at this time of the morning,
      and dressed like that?&#8221;</p>

    <p>Nancy took off her mask.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Nancy!?&#8221; Alan's face writhed as he tried to find a suitable
      expression. &#8220;But how come? I mean, why? Come in, my Lady,
      quickly.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Nancy followed his lead and took a seat in the living room,
      while her host disappeared. He returned a few minutes later, having
      undergone a complete change of image &#8212; he hadn't quite gone to the
      extremes of putting on a dinner jacket, but then again, he hadn't
      stopped far short of that.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Would you like something to eat, something to drink?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;What have you got?&#8221;</p>

    <p>He drew a deep breath, and opened his mouth, obviously about to
      list the contents of his larder, and then, thinking better of it,
      said, &#8220;Come and have a look.&#8221;</p>

    <p>They breakfasted together, on cereal, sitting at the kitchen
      table. Nancy had thrown her hood back, and let her hair fall
      back.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Were you really Honey McLain?&#8221; he asked, after a long pause in
      the conversation.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Then the other night when I called on you&#8230; I didn't offend
      you, did I, My Lady?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;No, in fact &#8212; well, I was more surprised than anything else. In
      fact, thank you. No one's ever said anything like that to me
      before. I suppose with relations, familiarity does breed contempt.
      She's a first cousin, once removed, by the way.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Who's that?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;My latest girlfriend, Tricia Kathrine. Just as a matter of
      interest, that is. I thought I had to tell you.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Thanks. I&#8230; I can't think of what to say &#8212; it's such a
      surprise seeing you &#8212; I never even dreamed that I'd ever actually
      talk to you, let alone this&#8230;&#8221; He swept his arm about, to indicate
      their surroundings.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Never mind. I'll tell you what &#8212; any time you want after all
      this is over &#8212; call on me. And if you decide to change sex in the
      meantime&#8230; I'm sorry &#8212; I don't really fancy men and I'm not
      that curious.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I think I know what you mean.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Yeah, I suppose you would, at that. I'd never thought about the
      view from your position.&#8221; Nancy paused, considering the
      ramifications of the idea, and then laughed. &#8220;Strange, thinking of
      it like that.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I suppose it would be. I suppose this is one time when telepathy
      would be useful &#8212; just finding out how other people see everyday
      things, what makes them tick. I suppose you could do with that
      these days. It might mean an end to all this squabbling your family
      has suffered these last thousand years. Though I don't suppose
      there, is any such thing as a &#8216;right&#8217; answer to the problem, it
      might just make negotiations easier.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;You said everyday things &#8212; and, my god, is it ever an everyday
      problem for us. I sometimes wish I'd been born someone totally
      unspecial &#8212; but I would miss the Castle. It's a marvellous place to
      live, and explore. It'll take me century or so to finish it, if I
      don't get bored meanwhile.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I wish you luck, then. I hope none of it gets damaged before you
      go.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Not much chance of that &#8212; even the original small castle was
      armed like a battleship &#8212; all the planetary defence lasers we could
      lay our hands on. I can't recall the figures, but I can recommend a
      few books on the subject.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;So if that was what the place was like then &#8212; what is it like
      now?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Uh-uh &#8212; careless talk costs lives &#8212; and other clich&eacute;s.
      Anyway, I don't know &#8212; but I wouldn't like to try taking the place
      without heavy orbital support, which fortunately, is unlikely. We
      have a lucky star which never sets, if you take my meaning.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;You mean a certain place not twenty three thousand miles from
      here.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Indeed. And I suppose it's really your telepathy idea in
      practice. Not that you could get a Linker telepath into a Council
      meeting, without someone screaming for the privacy of their own
      nasty minds. Not that I blame them too much &#8212; there are things I'd
      rather no-one else knew, about.&#8221; Nancy stepped, metaphorically, on
      the stream of examples that rose to conscious awareness.</p>

    <p>Alan's expression seemed to indicate that he too had a few
      private memories that he didn't care for and his face reddened.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I don't need to be a telepath to guess that one,&#8221; Nancy
      remarked.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Yes, I suppose not.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;It doesn't worry me. I've not got anything against you
      personally, in fact I like you &#8212; but&#8230;&#8221;</p>

    <hr />
    <p>Finally, she departed, leaving Alan at 09:30, and the University
      but a few minutes later. She was regretful now the moment of
      departure had finally come. She was leaving friends behind, however
      few in number, however distant they seemed to her, and she would be
      leaving them forever. The world was cruel to her, and it filled her
      with an anguish, that kept her silent during the flight home, and
      apart from her cousines who shared the minibus</p>

    <hr />
    <p>It was approaching 18:00 local time, or midday by the time-zone
      they had departed, when they approached to within spotting distance
      of Castle Wolf. They sped low over the gun-metal coloured ocean,
      with the sun at their backs, and ahead of them, grey cliffs rose,
      and white towers, gilded by the sunset light. A darkness hung over
      the towers, even to the great silvery shaft of the Upside Control,
      a darkness that formed part of a spherical surface, on which the
      skeins of smoke writhed and oscillated like the colours on a soap
      bubble. That feature was new, only established a few weeks
      previously; for the first time in nearly two centuries the
      <a href="annot.html#LifterFields">lift fields</a>
      were up, though yet not at full strength, but still adequate as one
      layer of their defences.
    </p>

    <p>The minibus circled once about the castle, while security checks
      were carried out and they drifted slowly through a gap that opened
      in the veiling. Below them, now, at last, massed the score square
      miles of castle, spread like a cancer of city upon the green land.
      They descended further, and then, even that analogy seemed to break
      down.</p>

    <p>From a location near its heart, and at no great altitude, the
      world became castle, there was nothing else that could be seen,
      save the mountains miles inland, which seemed to grow from the
      outskirts of the castle. A world indeed, Nancy thought, <i>my</i>
      world</p>

    <p>But a world which had to acknowledge an outside. The rooftop
      where the bus landed was guarded by a fireteam equipped with full
      combat support equipment, ready for a kamikaze attack on the part
      of supremely clever terrorists, and Nancy had no doubts that a
      further squad were concealed in vantage points overlooking that
      rather open roof.</p>

        <p>Nancy returns home</p>
      </div>
    </div -->

    <p>Suitcase in hand, Nancy stepped out onto the concrete, and
      looked around her, seeking her bearings from familiar locations. As
      well as the shifting veil above, there were vague shimmerings that
      might well be <a href="annot.html#Cybersoldiers">soldiers</a> on watch
      with heavy countermeasure shielding up. For an instant, she also
      saw one of the laser batteries open up. Her eyes followed their
      line, mistily traced in ionization up to the lift veil, which
      sparkled, and then blossomed into an explosion, black smoke, about
      a roiling heart of dull red fire. The thump of detonation came
      about two seconds delayed.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Mortar shell,&#8221; one of the guards explained. Across her helmet,
      the name Terry had been stencilled. &#8220;They come in about every ten
      minutes, and then the automatics get them. I think they're just
      trying to stop us getting a good night's sleep before we leave.&#8221;</p>

    <p>In rapid succession, two more explosions rang out, followed a
      second later by a third.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I thought you said every ten minutes.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Yeah &#8212; one pattern every ten minutes, there's some random
      element in their arrival times &#8212; Genevieve has the exact statistics
      to every decimal place that means anything but I do know we've got
      a good chance of eight minutes before the next bunch. It averages
      four shells per pattern &#8212; there's sometimes five, occasionally
      three, and I can't recall any larger or smaller runs ever taking
      place.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Where are they coming from then?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Westfield &#8212; which is about the only reason we haven't laid a
      nuke on the launchers &#8212; we can't even run an airborne raid to put
      them out 'cause they're being launched from a ship on the tarmac
      there. Damn' nuisance there's a Free Trader port on Wyvern. At
      least you can trust the Linkers even if they're against you.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Well, at college there, was a rumour going round that the
      Traders supplied arms to the matts there &#8212; they certainly weren't
      all using home-made stuff. A couple of the guys I know are on
      Trader scholarships are definitely matts. What more do you
      need?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;About five days. Hell, if the Traders are prepared to act that
      openly, and at that sort of level even before the Bill was passed.
      There's going to be something big lined up for half midnight
      tonight.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Uh?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;The twenty four hour hold Jeanne got put on the
      ratification.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I hadn't heard about that &#8212; when did they pass that?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Two hundred years ago &#8212; it's in the <a href="annot.html#Foundation">Treaty of Foundation</a>,
      cleverly
      disguised as a popular check on the powers of the Council. When
      petitioned by any citizen, the Leader of the Council must grant a
      twenty four hour stay of execution of any measure not given the
      unanimous assent of the Council, so as the public can register
      complaints. Jeanne was the only person who seemed to know about it
      and she was probably responsible for it, which might be taken as an
      explanation. I'm fairly certain it was designed with today in mind.
      Now they have to hold with it to maintain any sort of credibility
      on the interstellar scene. Otherwise we'd be knee deep now in
      protesters and petty bandits&#8230;&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Unfortunately we are just that &#8212; have you seen a radar view of
      the local area recently? When we were coming in, it was like flying
      through a snowstorm. I'd reckon there are about a thousand vehicles
      of one sort or another out there, and if more than one percent are
      legit, I'd be very much surprised.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Just like vultures. A pity we can't go out and shoot down a few.
      I'd like to take this rig out for real, one time.&#8221; She indicated the
      combat support suit she wore.</p>

    <p>&#8220;<a href="annot.html#Cousine">Cousine</a>,&#8221;
      Nancy suggested, &#8220;I'm sure you'll have more than enough of that
      before this is over. It's your turn to be shot at now. I can tell
      you that it stops being fun as soon as the other guy starts to
      shoot back. How old were you when we left Last Gasp?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Negative something.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Count yourself lucky. We've had to fight real primitive, not all
      mod cons like you'll have to. Have fun. See you around.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;See you, Nancy.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Terry looked around, and decided that she was no longer needed
      to watch the aircar. A scintillating, shimmering veiled her as she
      took off to resume airborne patrol. Nancy watched her fade from
      view, and then turned, and headed for the door. A smoky veil across
      the opening told of a <a href="annot.html#LowPass">low-pass field</a> in operation,
      making the indoors cooler and darker than otherwise it would have
      been. After the horizontal evening sunshine in her eyes, she needed
      to wait, until her vision was adjusted again.</p>

    <p>The floor on which she stood was polished stone, pale green,
      with mid grey swirls lined with white. The stone continued to her
      left, where it made a stairway, climbing to a landing, then
      doubling back above her head, and out of sight, and it continued to
      her right, to make three steps down to a cross corridor, carpeted
      in a matching pale grey green. A swirl of cool air reached her from
      the right hand arm of the passageway, bearing the scent of
      flowers.</p>

    <p>On the wall to her right, was a map of that level for the
      adjacent area, and she checked it for names, to confirm her
      location. As she had expected, she was close enough to her main set
      of rooms not to need to descend to the transit levels. She would
      instead go direct.</p>

    <p>The right hand passage was the most suitable route she decided.
      With a few shortcuts, it would be less than a quarter mile's
      walk.</p>

    <p>Fifty yards on, the corridor ended, and through a door, she came
      to a stairway, leading down. Two levels she followed it, and there
      parted company to rejoin the corridor net. Her way led northwards
      now, along a passage with wood panelled walls, and a floor tiled
      with wood in a herringbone pattern. To her left, windows opened to
      an abyss that descended beyond where any noticeable illumination
      fell. From the depths the sound of rushing waters rose a hundred
      yards below.</p>

    <p>Two hundred yards, the majority, almost, of her journey, she
      followed that corridor, until it, T-junctioned. The right-hand arm
      was only five yards long, ending in a leather panelled door, which
      revealed when Nancy pushed it open. a small room carpeted in red,
      and furnished with two wooden chairs, their seats upholstered in a
      like manner to the door.</p>

    <p>Across the chamber, another such door, leading her onto the
      gallery around a great hall. There were three long tables on the
      floor below, and benches along them, to seat the diners. Old
      paintings, darkened with age, formal portraits of the once
      important, lined the walls, which were of a dark oak. The musty
      odour of long neglect tainted the air, and dust specks drifted in
      the shafts of golden sunset light that poured in through a window
      in the far end wall.</p>

    <p>Another door opened ahead of Nancy, not quite directly across
      the hall, and she went to it, her footsteps echoing in the empty
      chamber as they trod on the oaken beams. The far door took her into
      a tall, narrow passage, with a diminutive door at the left-hand
      end. She hurried, not liking the cramped corridor, and wanting to
      be out.</p>

    </div>

    <p>Out was a <a href="annot.html#FuschiasAttic">lumber room</a>, seemingly neglected for centuries. Junk
      of generations past filled it, and dust covered it all in a soft
      white fur, save where her previous transits had worn a path through
      to the floor, plainly visible, though slightly covered again by the
      encroaching tide. She skirted the heaps of books and paintings,
      toys and models, to a wooden stairway, without handrail, and so
      steep as to be almost a ladder.</p>

    <p>On hands and knees, she climbed, into the room above. In direct
      contrast to the room below, this was brightly lit and empty, and
      the floor but bare panels of unvarnished pine, covered by a silvery
      dusting of grit that crunched underfoot. Below the window, open,
      unglazed, to the elements, was a wooden box. </p>

    <p>Nancy leaned out of that window. From its sill a crude bridge
      spanned the emptiness beyond, a twelve inch flanged girder of
      bright orange structural plastic that she had found, and epoxyed
      into position to save a five minute walk. The handrail was of
      similar origin.</p>

    <p>Using the box as a step, she climbed out onto the bridge, and
      crossed, not looking too long at the asphalt paving of the open
      ground, two hundred feet below. Above her, the sky opened out, and
      above the roofs of the immediate buildings, only a few feet above
      her head, the further ranks of structure, dominated by the mile
      high Upside Control.</p>

    <p>Another empty room welcomed her after that crossing, and she
      passed through, into a totally featureless corridor surfaced
      entirely in a slick grey plastic with a spongy texture, and
      illuminated by long opalescent panels in the ceiling. No one lived
      here; the only scents she could discern were of machines, the robot
      cleaners that were ever out of sight, possibly they were stored
      here. Whenever she took that route, Nancy decided to check whether
      that was the case, but she had never yet gotten around to it.</p>

    <p>The passage turned, and she was almost there, in that little
      island in the castle where she had sat up her primary residence. At
      last a borderline was behind her, that indefinite interface where
      one style of architecture gave way to another. With lightened
      steps, she skipped down the corridor to a broad spiral stairway,
      with an open core five yards across that plummeted all the way to
      ground level. Twice she circled that plunge, and then away along a
      passage to a locked door that surrendered to the touch of her hand.
      She put her case down, and flopped onto a couch.</p>

    <p>She sat there for a few seconds, just absorbing the familiar
      surroundings; a table left in disarray under the windows that lined
      the far wall, and beyond them, past the towers of the castle, and
      the forests beyond, the mountains of the Shalan Ti, grey and white
      against the washed out blue of the eastern sky, and clouds that
      were the final backdrop.</p>

        <p>Looking out of the window</p>
      </div>
    </div -->

    <p>The end wall, to the right of the windows, there was painted a
      mural, the work of one of her cousins who had been the previous
      occupant of these rooms. It showed a group of riders, all women,
      like a valkyrie band riding to war. They were all dressed alike, as
      if for a uniform, in leather jerkins, part unlaced in the heat, and
      leather breeches.</p>

    <p>Their leader, her arm raised in command, seemed to have reined
      her horse back only feet away, and now looked imperiously out into
      the distance. To her left, and behind her, the standard bearer held
      aloft an orange flag, charged with a hexagonal device in blue. The
      lush grass through which they rode rose so high that it hid the
      riders feet.</p>

    <p>Around the corner of the room, the scene continued. The grass
      became shorter, then gave way entirely to red sands, and the blue
      sky became a lowering greyish red, streaked as if with gradations
      of clouding, with white and grey and crimson. Mushroom-like trees,
      and fragile soaring towers rose out of the dunes, and in the
      distance, hills rose to the horizon, in a landscape from some
      fabled Mars.</p>

    <p>There was a knock at the door, breaking Nancy's trance.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Come in!&#8221; she called.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Hi there, Nancy.&#8221;</p>

    <p>The newcomer was a younger girl, in T-shirt and jeans, taller
      than Nancy, and with longer hair.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Hi there yourself, Julie. You sure didn't waste any time getting
      here. What gives?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Boredom. You're likely to be one of the few people with
      something new to talk about, anything except politics which
      unfortunately seems to have dominated the talking here for the last
      few weeks.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Okay. I'll try and think of something &#8212; but I tell you, it won't
      be easy. We didn't have much else going on this term. I'll just be
      glad when its all over. I suppose I could show you my war wounds.
      Let's find a medikit&#8230;&#8221;</p>

    <p>There was one in a desk drawer, and Nancy selected the items she
      would need.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I caught a bullet in this arm the other night she explained and
      I gummed it up with pink flavoured goo.We can see how its healing
      and change it for grey if we need.&#8221;</p>

    <p>She stripped off the shirt she had substituted for the Asroven
      cloak, and displayed the ugly wad of quasiflesh.</p>

    <p>Julie wrinkled up her nose.</p>

    <p>&#8220;That it?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;What do you want? Scars? Buckets of blood?&#8221;</p>

    <p>Nancy moistened a swab with solvent, and began to remove the
      dressing, peeling it away in long rubbery strings, to reveal
      unbroken, healthy flesh beneath.</p>

    <p>And when the last scraps of the dressing were gone, there was no
      visible evidence that she had ever needed it. There was not even
      any sign that she had even worn the dressing, no puckering or
      clamminess of the skin; just ordinary, unremarkable arm.</p>

    <p>&#8220;That's a bit of a pity. I'd hoped to have something to show for
      that. I got a ricochet there a couple of nights back, sure looked
      nasty enough at the time. I'll show you the jacket &#8212; lots of nasty
      red blood on that.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Red? I was going to ask &#8212; I thought you lot out at Uni had
      Changed &#8212; how come you're grey?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I woke up like that this morning. Last night I looked just like
      any of the cargs.&#8221; She smiled to herself &#8212; being home had one
      advantage above all the others &#8212; no longer the need for secrecy.
      Here she could use Clan slang of a sort that could have won her a
      knife between the ribs at college. Deriving from &#8126;cargo&#8127; the term
      &#8216;cargs&#8217; had been one of the more demeaning titles applied to the
      hapless colonists who had been chosen to settle Tau Ceti IV. By
      extension it now applied to anyone who was not a member of the
      Combine or who used haemoglobin as a blood pigment. &#8220;Now all I've
      got to show for it is a few inches of light brown hair that'll need
      dyeing some time before I see Tricia again.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Tricia &#8212; she the one decanted along with you?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Uh-huh. You can tell the model just to look at&#8230; My year,
      short, slim and flat chested was the style. Certainly changed
      before they nipped you &#8212; what were you? second batch after mine &#8212;
      nearly fourteen?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Yes. I've looked at my specs &#8212; it'll be a couple of years before
      I stop growing &#8212; six foot eight, and bulky. Not at all nice. When I
      can be bothered, I'll get modified more like you.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Thanks. It's nice to know someone else who thinks small is
      beautiful.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Easier to climb with, provided you don't care for long reach, if
      you want a practical point. More so if the new place has the silly
      gravity I hear it has. And you don't squash the person you're
      sleeping with so much. Talking of which, Nancy&#8230;&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Which we weren't, but I can take a hint when I hear one. Am I
      correct?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Essentially.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;OK,&#8221; she decided, &#8220;Call on me some time after dinner. I should be
      here, even if it is to do my hair. Now we've got that settled,
      what's been happening around here? How long till take-off?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Five days, a bit over. As for happenings, like every ten minutes
      we get bombed, and then there's a crazy sniper who keeps on taking
      pot-shots at lighted windows. Things like that we couldn't do
      anything about.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I used to complain at college, like that, even when we were able
      to go out and shoot back. But we can't do anything, of any meaning.
      I don't suppose anyone can. As long as the clans endure, there'll
      be idiots who read their history books and then decide that we are
      a Bad Thing &#8212; in capitals &#8212; and try to do their bit to help
      everyone else. We're on the defensive against the whole range of
      zanies and nutters, and that's on thing we can't get rid of.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Face it &#8212; what we're dealing with is the perversity of human
      nature &#8212; people too stupid or too dedicated to realize the
      essential worth of enlightened self interest, and apathy. Too
      goddamn many people feel they've got to do something, so by damn,
      they go out and do it, even if it hurts, because it's Right &#8212; all
      capitals. Unfortunately, the cargs don't have a monopoly on that
      sort of thing, like sister Astrid with her bright ideas about going
      out and shooting back when we could have all been tucked up nicely
      in bed.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Julie smiled. &#8220;With each other,&#8221; she suggested</p>

    <p>&#8220;With the bloody matts if need be. &#8216;Make love, not war&#8217; is not
      exactly a brand new idea, and a lot more fun. At least if doesn't
      have you gallivanting about roofs during the granddaddy of all
      thunderstorms. There was one of their girls I fancied only she was
      straight as a die. Always the way I suppose &#8212; and that's another
      advantage of being home.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Never mind. I'll see you tonight, then.&#8221; Julie walked away,
      pausing only to blow Nancy a kiss before shutting the door.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Genevieve!&#8221; Nancy called, as soon as the last sound of footsteps
      had faded, &#8220;I'm not in, not to anyone except Tricia. Could you run
      me a nice warm bath, and get me something to make my hair look
      normal again.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;At once, my Lady.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Nancy resumed her exhausted sprawl on the couch, until she was
      able to transfer to the bath, and continue that urgent exercise.
      She lounged in the warm water, letting all the frustrations of term
      unwind, and fade from her consideration.</p>

    <p>The time had flown, and not only the last couple of months. The
      years too had caught her unawares, with not one, but two, of the
      younger batches of girls growing up now. How Kari and Sue, and
      Astrid and Tessa thought of it, all too soon she would find out,
      crossing from her comfortably junior position among those of
      University age. She was worried about growing old at seventeen,
      while there were those in her family sixty times that and more.
      Change, rather than age, was the key. After, say, two hundred,
      things would alter little as centuries passed, but for now she had
      to wait a long while before she would have half a century to her
      credit, but she had undergone more change in her first handful of
      years than ever she would again &#8212; she was nearly the finished
      product now, awaiting the final, and long protracted,
      polishing.</p>

    <p>To hell with that she decided while she was young, she would,
      act it to the full.</p>

    <hr />
    <p>Her watch indicated 13:28, the wall-clock nearly half past
      nineteen hours, when she emerged from the bath, her hair now
      restored to its wonted silver, with a change of clothing waiting
      for her.</p>

    <p>The sun was set, its last colours reflecting from the mountains
      far away, fading even as she watched, while she dined, or as she
      reckoned it, lunched, alone in her room, and read a magazine.</p>

    <p>But when she had finished the last mouthful she gave up any hope
      of continuing to read. Quietly something was fermenting at the back
      of her mind, now that the initial elation at her homecoming was
      past. She felt disjointed after the sudden change in environment,
      in culture, in pace, and direction of life. She felt regret now,
      rather than relief, at being home and away from university, trapped
      at the intersection between those worlds.</p>

    <p>She would have liked to have been able to stay a few more days,
      with friends, with minds and interests that matched her ideas of
      fun, and not with family. A few more days, and everything, would
      have been all right. That thought seemed to tag itself along at the
      end of her wishful thinking, like a thing alien, welling up from
      the depths of her mind rather than being deliberately formulated,
      as if she had caught a whiff of someone else's thought.</p>

    <p>A few days, and all would be righted, they would be off-world,
      and once again, free to do as they pleased, even if that did
      exclude Wyvern. She shrugged and sighed. She already missed the
      friends she might never see again. Damn it, she was lonely here,
      even though there, were more people here she would talk to than at
      University&#8230;</p>

    <p>She pushed away the thought that she might be growing out of the
      Castle, and stood up, and pulled on a jacket. There was something
      that seemed to push her to action, to achieve some goal, and she
      could only lighten her soul ache by following it. She left a
      message for Julie and then was gone, through the corridors and
      west, taking the secret ways which only she might know, to a suite
      she had set up and secretly maintained, high in the Red Towers.</p>

    <p>A while, she sat there, and watched the castle, and than lay
      down on the bed, and contemplated the ceiling, and browsed a few
      books, and then she could not ignore the feeling of emptiness any
      longer.</p>

    <p>She found a bow, and a quiverful of arrows, and in a cupboard, a
      rather decrepit target which she set up in a nearby corridor and
      then filled with arrows until it was ragged and her fingers sore,
      and. then tiring of that game ran. She flew quite aimlessly through
      gloomy halls and corridors that seemed to have no end, past
      windows, murals and sombre paintings, wishing, that she could
      somersault, or even turn cartwheels, running until she had to suck
      in breath in great gasps.</p>

    <p>The activity had filled her, but without it, the melancholy took
      her once more, and she walked on. She found a small garden, with a
      swing. The evening was already too chill for her to lie on the
      grass, and swinging on the swing required too much effort &#8212; and
      besides, she had little enough breath to gasp out on the downswing,
      and it made her feel slightly sick.</p>

    <p>Time was stalled, it crept by, tormenting, her, asserting its
      right to withhold the resolution of her turmoil within. Slowly, the
      sky darkened to night grey, and the tingling silver of the rings
      built up about her, and yet the hour was only little past twenty,
      and Julie unlikely to be out of dinner for another half-hour. She
      looked forwards to their night together. It would provide welcome
      hours of amusement during which she could effectively shut off her
      mind, and then after that, sleep, which could be extended an
      indefinite time, and then Julie would still be there&#8230; Properly
      managed, that little escapade could kill a large span of time. She
      treasured that anticipation as she walked by the river, slowly back
      to her rooms while the cloak of night gathered itself around
      her</p>

    <p>Every ten minutes or so, the bombs came, ticking off the passage
      of time, and lights came on around the Castle, and sometimes off
      again. She had almost finished the detour.</p>

    <p>A bell. Twenty and one half hours of the day. Dinner would now
      be finished. With lighter tread, and faster, she hurried to her
      room, with first the gravel path beneath her feet, then concrete,
      and then wood.</p>

    <p>Julie was already whiting when she arrived, and she smiled.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I've been waiting for you.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Not too long, I trust How about a drink?&#8221;</p>
