    <p>The city was spectacular, a masterpiece in the art of cities. To
      one who had never seen a real city in her life, it was
      overwhelming. Nancy Elanor of Wolf sat at the terrace cafe, and
      just watched it.</p>

    <div class="hide" style="float:right;">
      <div
        style="padding:5px;border: black 1px solid;text-align: center;background-color: #eee;color:inherit">
        <img height="512" width="512" src="00039-1469303301.webp"
          alt="Nancy at the cafe table" />
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>To her left, the building fell sheer for a thousand feet or more
      to a square where the tiny shapes of people passed by, over lawns,
      and by rows of trees. That may have been the ground level here, but
      she doubted it. Opposite the drop, across the broad terrace, the
      soaring tower rose at least as far into the deep blue sky. Near its
      peak, so high that to look made Nancy's head swim with vertigo, the
      golden sunlight of the early morning gleamed on the white
      tower.</p>

    <p>The terrace lined a square, about two hundred yards on a side,
      forming a tiny ledge less than half way up the soaring shaft.
      Through deep gashes in the walls, the way led on, to the other
      squares of the city, and along them people swarmed, a. catalogue of
      the sentient races of the Partnership of Worlds, a nightmare
      bestiary. There were thousands in sight, more together in one place
      than she had ever seen before, so many that she could smell a
      composite musky scent of people. The sounds of footfalls, the
      rustle of clothes, the patter of conversation were louder than she
      had really conceived possible, like the ocean smashing against the
      cliffs, or wind in the trees.</p>

    <p>And in her mind, their thoughts swarmed formless, flashes of
      light, slippery and alive, a sentient rain in her head. She
      listened to everything wonderingly: all here was new; fresh and
      exciting, and she revelled in the exercise of her new-realized
      senses, catching at the thought-flecks, inconsequential
      disconnected snippets, half vocalized.</p>

    <p>She muffled the rush of other people's minds, and in the
      silence, resumed thinking herself. She sipped elegantly at her
      coffee and wrinkled her nose. Cateret was indeed crowded, crowded
      so she could feel and hear, smell see taste and think it, twenty
      five billion sentients on a planet fractionally larger than Earth.
      To her, it was unbelievable that people could bear to live on a
      planet fifteen hundred times as crowded as her native world; and
      yet they seemed to manage, here and on worlds yet more
      populous.</p>

    <p>A girl emerged from the crowd. She looked around the cafe
      tables, occupied mainly by breakfasters, pausing to stare at Nancy
      before continuing the sweep. Nancy took the opportunity to return
      the compliment. To her mind, the girl wasn't bad looking; slim,
      small breasted, and not too tall. She wore her black hair in a
      ponytail, and her sharp alert face hinted at feline qualities. The
      easy way she walked towards Nancy's table shared that suggestion of
      cat.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Do you mind if I sit down?&#8221; the newcomer asked.</p>

    <p>&#8220;No &#8212; be my guest. I'll buy.&#8221; Though Nancy had gone
      voluntarily into exile, she could still draw on the Clan's immense credit
      reserves, built up over the last thousand years, and hardly used.
      She could afford that much generosity.</p>

    <p>The girl ordered a breakfast, making a few exotic choices that
      surprised Nancy &#8212; many of the animals and plants providing the
      dishes, she had never heard of before, and those that she had, had
      never been used in that context &#8212; things used as savoury that she
      would have considered sweet, and vice versa.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I see you haven't been to Seafirth &#8212; everyone I eat with
      thinks the things I eat are funny. I suppose Skerry steaks in coffee is a
      little unusual. By the way &#8212; if I'm going to spend your money, I
      might as well introduce myself. I'm Nadia Bentley, I'm an academic
      student in psychophysics.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;My name's Nancy &#8212; Nancy Wolf, from Cimarron. I'm a maths
      undergrad.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Clan Wolf? Or is the hair just for fun?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Yeah &#8212; I just couldn't figure what colour to have my hair
      and eyes, so I just left them silver &#8212; I can always think of
      something if I have to.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;You're not afraid of reprisals? I'd be scared stiff some nut
      with a grudge would shoot me.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I've got no real choice. Anybody determined enough is going to
      find me if be really wants, and I daren't go home. You read about
      the troubles &#8212; well, the other side got hold of me on Wyvern, and
      twisted my mind, to make me work to destroy the Clan.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Couldn't the Linkers do anything?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;They daredn't &#8212; seems I'm a telepath, and all the rough
      handling I'd gotten had brought it to the surface. While I'm still working
      it out, they wanted to keep right out of my mind.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Hey &#8212; that's great. I can read minds a bit &#8212; it's what
      made me choose psychophysics as my field. I could help if you want.&#8221;
    </p>

    <p>Nancy reached for her bag, and the gun she carried. She didn't
      like the sudden turn of events.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Prove it &#8212; or I'll blow you in two.&#8221;</p>

    <p>As she spoke, she tried to listed to Nadia's mind, but there was
      only a blank</p>

    <p>Nadia threw a card over to Nancy, an Institute of Worlds ID,
      bearing out the story to the last detail.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Sorry,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I may be out and about, but I still
      get touchy, when people press me; and the last unsolicited help I received
      turned out to be the bad guys. I'm still trying to get rid of the
      do-it-yourself paranoia I had to cultivate during the troubles. A
      pause, and then : How did you shut your mind off like that?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;It's all right Nancy&#8230; Shut my mind off? no, I'm probe
      immune. I don't know what I do it just happens that way. There are
      only a few people who are. You're not one &#8212; that's why I came here
      &#8212; I could feel you open, unguarded.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Didn't the Guild warn you? There are things that can eat your
      mind, and puppet your husk. They always go for telepaths, beginners
      with their minds open, and no defences. I could teach you, and keep
      you safe.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;That's going to be difficult. I'm only here for today. I'm
      waiting for a connection to Earth.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Nadia paused for a few seconds. &#8220;To Hell with it she said, I can
      take what equipment I need with me, and I can write up results just
      as well shipboard. What ship, what time? I'll go and book.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Nancy told her, and then watched her disappear into the swirl of
      people. The breakfast she bad ordered lay on the table scarcely
      touched. Twenty minutes later, at the conclusion of a very
      leisurely breakfast, Nancy was about to give up hope and go when
      Nadia reappeared.</p>

    <p>&#8220;People,&#8221; she said, making it half a curse, half an
      explanation. &#8220;You'd never believe the queues for the public
      terminals. Not only that &#8212; some guy went berserk, shot a few people
      and dived off the ledge while I was there. It cleared the way to the
      terminals though. Then the fuzz turn up and want details. If I didn't have
      my Institute card, I'd still be there.&#8221;</p>

    <hr />
    <p>A wall of rock, worn by wind and water, vertical structure
      thrown sharply into relief by the oblique sunlighting, passed by
      the observation deck of the airship. Its rectangular shadow slipped
      across the rock far below, receding or reaching up close as the
      surface contorted.</p>

    <div class="hide" style="float:right;">
      <div
        style="padding:5px;border: black 1px solid;text-align: center;background-color: #eee;color:inherit">
        <img height="512" width="512" src="00032-3082346620.webp"
          alt="Nancy looking out from the airship" />
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>&#8220;You say you're a telepath, Nancy, but how much does that really
      mean?&#8221;</p>

    <p>Nancy was leaning on the rail, looking down the wind sculptured
      surface of rock, strata of buff and red and purple, trying to
      identify them from the guidebook. Nadia had her back to the edge,
      looking across the open deck, to the broad expanse of the canyon,
      where towers of rock cast their shadows into night-dark gorges, or
      like sundials across open areas. Beyond them, half seen in the
      shimmer of the horizon, rose snow capped mountains.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I can catch fragments &#8212; if people are close, and verbalise
      their thoughts, I can read them quite well, if there aren't too many
      other people about, and then I can stop listening, and that's about
      all I've tried. There's something else I've noticed too &#8212; since
      about the same time I seem to heal almost instantly &#8212; does that
      always happen to telepaths?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Always? I'd never even heard of that happening. Are you
      sure?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Yeah, but I'm not giving demonstrations &#8212; it still hurts,
      and that's more than enough for me.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;We'll have to see if we can do anything about that. My talent is
      a bit anomalous, too. I can feel what people are doing when they're
      using any paranormal ability &#8212; if they don't block me &#8212; and
      I've examined quite a range of abilities. One of them could selectively
      dampen his sensory responses &#8212; pain among them. I'll have to try
      you at that.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Mmh.&#8221; Nancy turned to her search to identify the Lower
      Beckman Sandstone, amongst three or four practically identical beds.</p>

    <p>By lunch time, they had reached the mountains. The sky was
      overcast, and the mountains were thickly covered with untouched
      snow. Rocks and sheer ridges of rock showed as black by contrast.
      The colourlessness of the scene seemed to drain all warmth from the
      air, and Nancy shivered, despite the steady cabin temperature of
      295.</p>

    <p>She cut a mouthful of steak. Its warmth was as welcome as the
      taste, and the sating of her hunger.</p>

    <p>&#8220;What are you working on in your research?&#8221;</p>

    <p>Nadia started.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Sorry, you startled me. Research, now&#8230; she wiped her mouth
      on her napkin, and swallowed. Linker talent &#8212; I'm trying to
      determine whether the current theory is wrong, or if it's some fault in
      the practical application.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;You mean the Coherence Failure?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Yeah. It's all very well having a theory predicting an
      effectively infinite shift radius, but when in practise, we can't
      keep the tolerances acceptable beyond twenty lites. Things match up
      fine up to then, but then everything goes haywire. There's not even
      a noticeably different threshold for different races &#8212; at 20.68
      lites, when theory suggests uncertainty errors should be less than
      a hundred meters with five nines probability, things we send
      through can end up literally anywhere. When the Institute tried it
      last, they went through a few thousand beacons, moving the
      receiving station a couple of AU each time.</p>

    <p>&#8220;There was a five AU band where the beacons surfaced within a
      couple of lites of the receiver, but after that we had to retrieve
      them from all the way over the Partnership. There are still sixteen
      missing, with not a word. They've got an indefinite lifespan, so we
      might find them when we start exploring other galaxies.</p>

    <p>&#8220;The coherence bit comes in like this &#8212; the average Linker
      can reach about 3 lites, when you put more together, they can reach
      further &#8212; that's alright, it's expected that units aren't perfect,
      so when you run them together they can draw on each other's
      strengths. It's just when you put a fifth Linker in, she isn't able
      to push the distance up like she should. Instead of going from
      about sixteen to twenty two lites, the range doesn't budge beyond
      20.68. Everything. else; the size of object they can shift, the
      cycle rate, fatigue, tallies with theory.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Some people are trying to rebuild the theory from scratch so it
      incorporates a catastrophe point where practise shows one, and I'm
      trying to improve the mechanism, to remove it. I'm convinced it's a
      basically biological failure in the integration process; so that if
      you could manufacture a series of entities with a, say, twenty five
      lite range they could form a team with a range of nearly two
      hundred lites, assuming the same coherence threshold.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Have you had any results?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Some, but not what I was looking for. I managed to build one
      which apparently could shift without need of a receiver &#8212; it just
      disappeared one day, so I gave that approach up. I'm just casting
      about for new ideas now. I may try building the maths to a theory
      incorporating teleportation &#8212; seeing if that forces a coherency
      limit&#8230; Hell. Let's forget this for a while. I'm grabbing a
      chance for a short break from work to help you, and to do something
      different. From my work that is.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Any suggestions what we should talk about then?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;We could just be tourists, admire the scenery. Save our
      conversation for on the ship, when there's nothing much else to
      do.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Nancy smiled. &#8220;I can think of at least one thing &#8212; that's not
      counting telepathy.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Nadia sat for a moment with a blank expression, before
      everything clicked. &#8220;Yeah. I'd forgotten that all your Clan were
      gay, too.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Not all. I have an uncle who would resent that accusation.&#8221;
    </p>

    <hr />
    <div class="hide" style="float:right;">
      <div
        style="padding:5px;border: black 1px solid;text-align: center;background-color: #eee;color:inherit">
        <img height="512" width="512" src="bing240226-103448_9963.jpg"
          alt="The star gate opens" />
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>The StarLink station hung in space like a piece of fantastic
      jewellery; a nine kilometre ring, with at one point, a profusion of
      globes, spars and planes. Around this efflorescence a swarm of
      ships hung, some mote-like, others nearly as large as its kilometre
      span; freighters, liners, even a renovated slowboat a thousand
      years old, the lifeblood of interstellar commerce.</p>

    <p>As Nancy watched from the shuttle window, the ring blinked like
      an eye. Green, gold and red fire blossomed at its centre, and
      rushed outwards, framing a view of another world. Ships passed
      through this tear in space, and then it shimmered. Fire poured into
      the centre, until the whole ring swam with colour like a soap
      bubble. Reds vanished towards the edge, blues appeared in the
      centre, then black, and like a soap bubble, it burst.</p>

    <p>The ring grew as they approached, vast, distorted by its own
      size, and passed out of sight as they entered the faerie growth of
      the station proper, white in the sunlight, and black almost
      indistinguishable from space where shadow fell. A gentle bump
      signified the contact, and an explosive report, the final sealing
      to hard dock.</p>

    <p>Nancy felt Nadia tense as the docking completed, and as soon as
      they were told that they could debark, she stood up, and hurried
      against the flow of people to the freight hold. Nancy called her
      name, but the only response was a muttered See you Something in
      Nadia's single-minded concern for the safety of the equipment she
      had brought along, the furtive way that she had both at the ground
      station and now here, hurried off to supervise its movement,
      worried Nancy, but she couldn't trace it. It might be some esper
      sense warning her of something, or the simple tension of blocking
      the trivial thoughts of thousand thousand thousand minds, paranoia,
      or the shattered feeling of a crowded bustling day. One thing that
      was certain, and overrode the concern for Nadia's mental state; and
      that was the use she could make of her claimed talents &#8212; that much
      of her story she believed.</p>

    <p>Nancy followed the last of the rush of people out into the entry
      concourse. She found an unused terminal there, and checked the
      status of her luggage, and gave instructions for its loading onto
      the liner. Even after a few minutes wait, there was no sign of
      Nadia, so she gave up, and headed down the driftway. There was a
      strange feeling in passing along the long glowing tunnels of the
      station, away from the bustle of people in the waiting lounges; a
      feeling of the strains and fluxes of space-time, like a mighty
      ocean that could wash away the whole Link station like a seashell
      if it ever broke through. If that was what she could feel from the
      conscious minds of Linkers to be one would be awesome. She could
      understand the high and lonely attitude they maintained, for when
      one can ride the tides of the Universe, everything else is tired
      and mundane.</p>

    <p>In the soaring weightlessness of the driftways, the borrowed
      splendour was euphoric, intoxicating; the return to gravity in the
      liner, an unwelcome, inevitable return to normality. Nadia was
      there already, waiting in the docking lounge. She seemed completely
      carefree now, excited like a young girl</p>

    <p>&#8220;You know,&#8221; she said, &#8220;this is the first time I've been
      in space&#8230; for almost ten years.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I hadn't even been offworld before I left home a couple of
      months ago. All your gear packed away safely now? You seemed quite
      concerned about it.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I suppose I was; but then it did take me long enough to build
      &#8212; couldn't even use standard parts for most of it had to ship them
      in from Symbaree and Lisston, some of them. There's a few measurements
      of Link parameters I want to make test a few ideas of mine. Shall
      we go to your cabin now?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;We can &#8212; but when we get there, I'm having a hot drink and
      I'm going straight to bed. Alone. I'm absolutely dead beat now. Might
      not be a bad idea for you to get some sleep too &#8212; you seem a bit
      edgy.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Sure, Nancy. See you tomorrow.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Nancy walked over to the ship plan to locate her cabin. Edgy had
      not really been the word to describe Nadia's condition; in heat
      would be closer, judging by the dilation of her pupils. Pressure of
      work and a lack of companionship for a long time, and then a
      sudden, justifiable excuse to get away from it all &#8212; almost anyone
      would overreact in those circumstances, and Nadia had told her as
      much. No wonder the girl was acting touchy.</p>

    <hr />
    <p>&#8220;No, no and no!&#8221; Nancy's denial broke a long silence.
      &#8220;I'm not doing anything more today. My mind is blown &#8212; all
      over the walls &#8212; it aches. We've been working for &#8212; what, ten
      hours now &#8212; and what have we proved ? Nothing we didn't know already
      &#8212; except for &#8212; what did you call it?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Astral projection &#8212; I don't know if there's a technical term
      for it&#8230;&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Well &#8212; whatever it was &#8212; that's all we've achieved.
      All the other fancy talents you've tried have ranged from slight promise
      to not in my line at all.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;All right, Nancy. We'll call it a halt then; try again
      tomorrow.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Sure. Sorry about that, Nadia &#8212; my turn to be edgy tonight.
      Care for a cup of coffee?&#8221;</p>

    <p>They were in Nancy's cabin &#8212; had been all day. The only light
      was from the turquoise and white globe in the centre of the
      transparent wall; the world called Halfhaven, a hundred and
      eighteen lites from Cateret on the run to Earth. Nadia was sprawled
      in an armchair in one window corner, Nancy lounged on a sofa facing
      the window, where, one after another, a series of planets had
      passed. She stood up, and brushed her hair from her face. A small
      red light marked the dispenser. She dialled, narrowly missing
      making a double order for cognac &#8212; one black, one with milk and
      sugar.</p>

    <p>She carried the two cups over to Nadia, and handed her one. She
      perched on one arm of the chair.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Why aren't you with the Linker's Guild?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Planetary politics. The Free Traders opened up Seafirth, and the
      influence lingers on. The Guild is fine as a monopoly cartel on
      rapid starflight; but I just don't feel that gives them the right
      to monopolise every paranormal talent &#8212; besides, I have my own life
      to lead &#8212; there are even Linkers who don't work for the Guild
      &#8212; academics, adventurers, and artists mainly. They keep tabs on some
      of them; others they ignore, others they don't know about. I'm
      pretty certain I'm in the last class. I don't think they're tracing
      you, either.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Take my word for it &#8212; that's the way to stay. It's a pity
      they already know about you &#8212; but there are ways of escaping, even
      from them&#8230;&#8221;</p>

    <p>Nadia's voice trailed into silence. she lay in the chair,
      completely relaxed, only her eyes alert. The cup of coffee steamed
      on the table beside her, completely forgotten. Then suddenly as it
      came, the trance broke.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Memories.&#8221; she said.</p>

    <p>&#8220;There's no need to get morbid about it. Come on &#8212; I know how
      to stop you worrying &#8212; make up for yesterday&#8230;&#8221;</p>

    <hr />
    <p>The room was dark. There were the sounds of movement, ragged
      gasps, gentle moans.</p>

    <p>Unnoticed, the gauzy structure of the Link station, and the
      gleaming arc of the LinkGate drifted into sight, eclipsing the
      world there. The liner drifted into the whirlpool that had been
      ripped into space. Around it, along the entire length of the
      wormhole, colours played. They could be seen close at hand through
      the stateroom window-wall, bright and almost metallic, with a
      streaky structure, fading into absolute black between colours.
      Though they glowed brightly, there seemed no increase in
      illumination due to them, only a faint play of colour in the
      gloom.</p>

    <p>An animal noise rent the air; all the more ghastly for having
      been framed by a human throat. It seemed to have been intended to
      be a scream, but it was gurgled, and abruptly cut short. There was
      a violent movement on the bed, and Nancy collapsed to the floor.
      She crawled away, the light playing on the skin of her back, and
      screamed, a terrible long sob of a scream. Her breath gurgled, as
      she staggered to her feet and recoiled into a corner, and half sat,
      half collapsed there, leaning against a view of the madness
      outside.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Thing!&#8221; The word was half screamed, half sobbed. Any more
      was lost in hysterical tears.</p>

    <p>Nadia hurried over to her, and slapped her on the face.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Nancy &#8212; listen to me!&#8221; she snapped.</p>

    <p>Nancy's eyes focused. &#8220;A thing,&#8221; she gasped between the
      racking sobs, &#8220;A thing, it was in my mind. It hated me &#8212; it
      hadn't been born &#8212; It was trying to tear me apart&#8230;&#8221;</p>

    <p>She clung to Nadia for support, and cried until she could cry no
      more.</p>

    <hr />
    <p>Nancy paced through the deserted corridors of her part of the
      ship, heading from her wedge, now, at 04:30, towards the earlier
      zones. She was scared, but it was an intellectual sort of fear that
      assailed her. All gut feelings had been burned out of her earlier,
      when her mind had been invaded by &#8230;something, unknown, but
      malignant.</p>

    <p>Her mind had been quite open while lying with Nadia, her only
      shielding requiring far too much effort to maintain. Then, without
      any warning, or build-up, something black had exploded in her
      consciousness. It struck as an arctic storm would have in that
      room, and then. there had been a flood of physical sensations,
      cold, and pain , but they were secondary, side effects of the main
      burst of malignant hate. Her self had been almost drowned in that
      outpouring of the dark things of the mind. It was Hell, uncorked
      and boiling over.</p>

    <p>She didn't remember, except by being told about it, what had
      happened next, but that didn't concern her as much as the actual
      fact of the event. Nadia hadn't noticed any paranormal activity,
      though she confessed to being otherwise occupied at the time. She
      was of the opinion that what had affected Nancy was somehow related
      to that particular link they had been going through at the time, or
      possibly had something to do with the attendant circumstances at
      the time of Link. Nancy's own opinion was that she had been exposed
      to the depths of her own mind, possibly triggered by any of the
      prevailing conditions.</p>

    <p>Even yet, doped up with anti-hysteria preparations, and in
      memory there was a shard of recollection that could trigger fright
      reactions &#8212; a vision of unseeing eyes, full of malice, beneath a
      swelling brow.</p>

    <p>She had left Nadia asleep, when, in the early morning she had
      woken, had dressed, kissed her gently on the lips, and gone out to
      try and sort her mind out in the winding miles of the ship. She
      avoided people when she could feel their minds near her, to stay
      alone with her thoughts.</p>

    <p>Then, faint but unmistakable, on the edges of her mind, she felt
      a whiff, a mere trace of the demoniac mentality that had erupted in
      her mind; and with it a feel of direction. She followed that
      elusive wisp of being, keeping it on the threshold of perception,
      in towards the axis of the ship, and aft.</p>

    <p>Here it became impossible to avoid people, where the time-zones
      mingled and life went on twenty four hours a day: here where all
      the entertainment functions went on; gambling, dancing, gymnastics,
      and others. Nancy pushed impatiently through the crowds, trying to
      ignore the roar of their thoughts, shallow stupid and banal, as she
      clung to a thought that was a smell of sulphur in her head. She
      relinquished it only when she had chased it as far as she could,
      and made certain of its source : somewhere in the hold.</p>

    <hr />
    <p>Twenty minutes later she was back at the sealed bulkhead door
      marked <strong>Ship's Hold &#8212; Authorised Personnel Only</strong>
      that had ended her previous search. Much of the time had been taken
      up by convincing Nadia that she had actually contacted something
      real, and then in going through the paperwork authorising them to
      inspect Nadia's cargo, ostensibly to check its performance to
      date.</p>

    <p>This time the door opened, and they climbed down a metal ladder
      into the hold. Nancy cast around for the mind she had followed, and
      touched it. She felt nauseated by its unclean aura, but moved
      towards it, down level by level, and past the hulking masses of
      crates and bales.</p>

    <p>That which she sought stood alone in a square space formed by
      leaving a long gap in one of the rows; and she recognised it at
      once &#8212; or at least its essentials. Beneath the various items added,
      it was a standard ectogene tank, such as she herself had been born
      from; and in it, something lived, something utterly malevolent &#8212;
      something unborn.</p>

    <div class="hide" style="float:right;">
      <div
        style="padding:5px;border: black 1px solid;text-align: center;background-color: #eee;color:inherit">
        <img height="512" width="512" src="00017-3564350399.webp"
          alt="Nancy has mayhem on her mind" />
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>Nancy closed her mind as tightly as she knew how, and looked
      about for something to smash the unit, and its diabolical occupant.
      A bundle of metal rods caught her eye, some special alloy according
      to the label. She pulled one of the rods from the bundle, and held
      it; it was heavy, about six feet long , and half an inch diameter,
      and according to the specs, hard, tough and most refractory.</p>

    <p>She walked towards the tank, to check the owner's name.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Nancy &#8212; what is it?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I've found it. Now get back&#8230; Oh my god &#8212; you. Why,
      Nadia?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;This was my Linker-type entity &#8212; the one I said had
      vanished&#8230;&#8221; The tone of the voice changed, &#8220;But I didn't
      vanish. I dispossessed her of her body, for cheating me of mine. And now,
      I'm going to take your body.&#8221;</p>

    <p>At that last declaration, Nancy felt something click shut at the
      back of her head, and her legs just seemed to vanish. She swung the
      bar down with all her might, tearing loose wires and life-support
      tubes from the central tank. A trickle of blood and amniotic fluid
      ran down the sides of the tank, before the fail-safes cut the flow.
      The next swing was aimed at Nadia who had launched herself at
      Nancy, and she felt ribs give under the blow . She staggered back
      on wooden legs as the mangled body hit the floor. It landed
      silently, and writhed across the floor towards her. With a shock,
      she realized that she had lost her hearing &#8212; and was losing more
      and more control of her body. She brought the bar down with all her
      strength on the cluster of apparatus, to smash the tank and its
      occupant &#8212; she couldn't wait for anoxia to lay it low.</p>

    <p>The plastic of the tank went from an opaque grey to cloudy under
      the blow. With the berserker rage on her, and scared to the core of
      her being, she struck again, and again. A great mass of plastic
      fell away, and the end of the rod came away bloody.</p>

    <p>Without warning, she was falling, and she saw that Nadia's body
      had grabbed her around the ankles. Nancy flung her weapon away as
      she felt her last ties on her body being torn away, and reached for
      the dying husk at her feet.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I'm free &#8212; and I am Nancy Elanor of Wolf now.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Nancy heard her own body mouth those words, as she listened with
      Nadia's ears. The body felt strange &#8212; it was damaged, unfamiliar,
      her control of it poor, but she dragged it along, and fastened both
      hands about her own throat, and just hung on. Her adversary poured
      all its spleen on her, but her mind was too benumbed by its
      previous attack. It eroded her mind but could not dislodge it.</p>

    <p>Then, the universe detonated; and she was carried out on the
      shockwave of Nadia's exploding consciousness; and when it was none,
      she found herself floating in some limbo, with only one thing there
      to be sensed. She reached for it, and was embodied again. Eyes
      opened, focused &#8212; it was her own body, dead on the floor, that she
      occupied. Dead arms reached up and pushed the hands from her
      throat. And she breathed.</p>

    <p>She lay there, as her body mended, drawing thankfully at the
      air. She shied from thinking of how close the outcome had been.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Nancy? Are you all right?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Who's that?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Me &#8212; Nadia. I'm back from Hell. Now for God's sake get me a
      doctor. The last words were wheezed through gritted teeth, a
      trickle of blood running from between them.&#8221;</p>

    <hr />

    <div class="hide" style="float:right;">
      <div
        style="padding:5px;border: black 1px solid;text-align: center;background-color: #eee;color:inherit">

      </div>
    </div>

    <p>Nancy was alone again, as she had been before. She could work up
      no enthusiasm for any of the entertainments that the ship could
      offer, and instead was content to remain in her room, passing her
      time by reading books or watching films. In the empty moments
      between, she often picked up and read the hard copy she had taken
      of the last message she had received from Nadia.</p>

    <p>'Sorry,' it began,' but I couldn't stay; I've got far too much
      work lined up, a whole new line of approach to find. That thing I
      had grown had been sentient for just three months when we destroyed
      it; it was only days old when it possessed me, and pushed me into
      some hell inside me.</p>

    <p>'Thanks for letting, me out.</p>

    <p>'Love and kisses, Nadia.</p>

    <p>'P.S. The institute is paying for this; that's why you don't
      have to decipher it from compact.</p>

    <p>For all that they had been lovers, for all that Nancy had
      released Nadia from months of imprisonment within herself, they had
      been like ships in the night, without the real contact required for
      friendship. Had there been more time, more common ground&#8230;</p>

    <p>With quiet regret, Nancy dropped the folded sheet of paper onto
      the table by her chair, and sat staring into the depths of
      space.</p>

    <h2>Afterword 1976</h2>

    <p>The whole idea came from a dream I had in August '76, hearing
      which caused [one of the Cambridge University SF society writers'
      workshop group] to accuse me of having a diseased mind. This is how
      the original inspiration mapped into fixed form.</p>

    <p>I saw the picture of the scene on the opening page, including
      Nancy leaning her elbows on the rail at the edge and looking over.
      Then my viewpoint seemed to coincide with Nancy's location, and I
      saw Nadia approach. The surname I made up later, but I knew from
      that instant that she was called Nadia. Although this was shortly
      after the Montreal Olympics, and the name probably came from Nadia
      Comaneci, her appearance was that of her fellow eastern-bloc
      gymnast Theodora Umgureanu.</p>

    <p>The other part I visualised in dream was the denouement. Partly
      I dreamed I read it in <cite>Analog</cite>; it was part of a short
      (about six pages) Telzey Amberdon story. The open double page I saw
      was the third and fourth of text, and were tinted grey. There was
      an illustration in the style of Schoenherr occupying just over the
      upper half of the right hand page. It depicted Nancy, her back
      turned, feet planted wide, (but out of frame, which came down to
      about knee height), with the metal rod in hand, drawing it back
      high over her right shoulder to deliver an oblique chopping blow to
      the ecto-tank. Nancy was wearing a waistcoat like little jacket and
      a knee length skirt, her hair was straight, and, not quite shoulder
      length.</p>

    <p>All I can remember of the text is the phrase the shockwave of
      Nadia's exploding consciousness . There is then a memory of the
      direct sight of Nancy thrown back into the corner of a room, bathed
      in a terrible light. this room was about a hundred yards in front
      of and a hundred yards above where Nancy was sitting in the cafe,
      coordinates oriented from her initial location.</p>

    <p>I waited about a month to commit the story to text, as I wanted
      to finish [the first draft of] <cite>Moving Day</cite> first. When
      I did finally get down to writing it, I inserted the tour of the
      planet, to use up a couple of picturesque sets, and of logical
      necessity relocated the showdown in a plot summary that included
      Nadia's motivation.</p>

    <h2>Afterword 2000</h2>

    <p>This was the sort of tale I'd intended to have set Nancy up for,
      as a novice telepath, and unwitting werewolf. But in order to set
      that up, I brought in the alien artifact I used in <cite>Moving
        Day</cite> to set up a radiation accident and trigger her powers.
      Alas, it had its own ideas of where things were going; and I ended
      up with the next &#8212; and fragmentary tale</p>

    <p>The whole Coherence Failure bit was tacky at the time; I dislike
      it more at this distance, but need something to give reason for
      Nadia to be growing psis-in-a-tank. The comments are contradictory
      of the original source for the interstellar psionic teleport, the
      <cite>StarForce</cite> game, and it contradicts other unfinished
      story fragments from the same setting in which the Linkers retained
      the source material's ability to transport ships without sender or
      receiver station. There are some story based reasons in Moving Day
      for keeping the Linker ability to a fixed-station to fixed-station
      setting, keeping the rest of interstellar travel to mechanical
      means; but when I started a Linker-centred story at the time of the
      Ggappi conflict, about 500 years before the time of the story
      above, I needed to have the <cite>StarForce</cite> style
      properties.
    </p>

    <p>None of the above is compatible with the Linker-as-Transcendi
      Y2K-epoch reinterpretation. Nor is the story entirely consistent
      with the secret origin, as she seems now to have changed her skin
      colour.</p>

    <h2>Afterword 2024</h2>

    <p>With the advent of AI art, I could at least approximate the illustrations
      imagined all those years ago, and do a few more besides. At the same time
      I also defined that as she was grey skinned in the unfinished <cite>Moving
        Day</cite> sequel set about 80 years later along her timeline that she'd
      still be grey-skinned here, too.
    </p>

    <p>Having not read the afterword, I used Ms. Comaneci as face prototype for
      Nadia's one on-screen appearance; I may rework it at some point, but one
      could hardle tell.</p>
