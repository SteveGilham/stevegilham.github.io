    <p>The morning dawned bright and clear after the storm; only a few
      puffy cumulus clouds hung in the sky, gleaming brilliantly white in
      the new-washed light of the sun. They sailed, in irregular rows,
      across the deep blue vault of heaven, from the north, under the
      misty arch of the rings, to vanish in the pastel shading around the
      southern horizon. A light wind urged them on in their majestic
      flight, and rustled the leaves in the trees. The lizards sang in
      the branches, to greet the dawning of the new day.</p>

    <p>Nancy, for her own part, received the tidings with a more
      reserved reaction. She drifted imperceptibly from dreaming to
      awareness over a period of several minutes reluctantly surrendering
      the last gossamer webs of comfortable unreality. Her eyes were
      still closed, though she woke, and she lay for a while, trying to
      order the sequences of her dreams. One hovered at the edge of
      recall something that had frightened her, but was now forgotten,
      save for one blurred still of a ring of standing stones.
      Regretfully, she abandoned the tantalizing memory.</p>

    <p>She forced her eyes open to the brightness of morning. The
      shadows of the trees fell sharply outlined, silhouettes of total
      dark, on the quasi-frosted surface of the window. They danced
      gently as the wind blew, long narrow ribbon shapes of leaves,
      crossing and opening and every once in a while, casting through
      transient pinholes foreshortened projections of the sun's disk.</p>

    <p>Nancy watched their hypnotic dance, until the motion, and the
      glaring contrast of the light, made her eyes too heavy to hold
      open. She did not fight the warmth and drowsiness.</p>

    <p>Time passed, in indefinite quantity &#8212; seconds, minutes, for all
      she knew or cared, an hour &#8212; before again she woke. She had turned
      over while she had dreamed and this time could see the <a href="annot.html#DigitalWatch">clock
        function set up on the display screen</a>. It
      indicated a time a few seconds before 08:30. Continued oblivion
      cast its Lorelei lure, but she had a lecture at 10:00, and decided
      not to risk it. Instead she would allow herself until the
      half-hour, watch the glowing digits as they rolled on, and then
      stir herself to get up.</p>

    <p>Fifty eight, fifty nine, zero zero. The last numbers counted off
      like the final moments of the universe, reached, and passed the
      time appointed. Nancy stirred gently, so as not to disturb Carol,
      who slept beside her. Having slipped out from under one of Carol's
      outstretched arms, she sat up, tenderly nursing her injured arm.
      She stood, and walked out to the kitchen, kicking on her slippers
      as she went. She poured herself a glass of fruit juice, pale green,
      and sharp flavored, to cut through the dryness of her mouth,
      sipping it slowly, lingering to make the relief longer
      enduring.</p>

    <p>With that, and a handful of sultanas, she returned to her room,
      and began to work at the desk display console. She ate, and drank,
      seemingly disinterestedly as she checked the progress of one of her
      little projects &#8212; <a href="annot.html#InterstellarInternetWorm">a randomly wandering program</a> that had
      passed
      along the interstellar telecoms links, had now reached delta
      Pavonis,
      only a score lites from Sol, with relatives in computer complexes
      in nearly twenty percent of the Partnership systems. She noted down
      a few items of interest, then cleared the screen.</p>

      <div class="hide">
        <div style="padding:5px;border: black 1px solid;text-align: center;background-color: #eee;color:inherit">
          <img height="592" width="440" src="00743-13767610.png" />
          <p>Sitting at her desk</p>
        </div>
      </div>  

    <p>Another set of codes, and this time she gained access to a
      routine she had unofficially inserted into the operating system,
      and then was allowed to reset its countdown to one hundred days.
      Were that count ever to expire, the routine would set to work on a
      thorough destruction of the system, at least as far as the actual
      normal use of it was concerned.</p>

    <p>She wondered what she should do with it. In less than a week,
      the Clan Wolf would depart, acknowledging the public opinion
      against them &#8212; ironically the complete contradiction of the main
      charge levelled against them, that they cared nothing for the
      feelings of anyone not of the Old Clans.</p>

    <p>In those circumstances, she would be unlikely to be able to do
      anything after then, and then, in course, the Armageddon would
      come. She hesitated, began to type in the code that would erase the
      routine, but halted with a pang of remorse. Could she really
      destroy out of hand something so beautifully nasty?</p>

    <p>She negated the line, and logged off. With a little work, it
      could be made specific, to act as her instrument of revenge against
      those who would remain. There would be time enough for that to be
      done. She cleared all trace of that secret transaction from the
      screen, downed her drink, and went to prepare her breakfast.</p>

    <p>A fat wedge of pinky-red melon lay, bleeding its sticky juices
      onto the tabletop, the remainder being returned to storage, when a
      startled yell of &#8220;Ohmigodwhatsthetime!&#8221; emanated from the bedroom,
      announcing plainly that Carol had abruptly woken.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Just gone twenty five to nine,&#8221; Nancy called back, &#8220;Want something
      to drink?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Of course. Hot, cold or alcoholic?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Gageapple juice suitable?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;It's wet, isn't it?&#8221;</p>

    <p>Nancy poured two glasses of the juice, and shook the carton. As
      its weight suggested, and the silence confirmed, it was empty. She
      threw it into the bin, then retrieved the melon and cut a second
      wedge.</p>

    <p>Collecting the whole lot on a tray, she returned to the bedroom,
      to find Carol sitting up in bed, wide eyed, and with hair tousled.
      Nancy set the tray down on the desk, studiously disregarding
      anything already there, and handed one to Carol.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Two gets you ten it clouds over by the time lectures are over,&#8221;
      she commented cynically, &#8220;Weather?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;No &#8212; the weather will remain much as it is, with the cloud cover
      diminishing to 5%. Air temperatures &#8212; presently <a href="annot.html#Units">285</a>, but rising to 298
      later this afternoon. Do you wish a more detailed or extensive
      forecast?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;See.&#8221; Carol smiled. &#8220;There's no need to be so bitchy. Okay, we've
      got an algebra lecture, and we both agree it's a pain &#8212; so we both
      suffer. Besides, it's the last one.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Anyway, on a different tack entirely &#8212; how's you arm this
      morning?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;A bit stiff, hurts if I strain it, but it'll last until we get
      home, give it some proper attention.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Good job it wasn't your <a href="annot.html#Writing">writing hand</a>, then.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Mmh. Thinking of that &#8212; I wonder what the matts'll do after
      that.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I can't see what they can do. The yogis will be out in force for
      a couple of days, and by then it'll be the end of term, and we'll
      all be home.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;That's never stopped us though, has it?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I suppose so.&#8221; &#8212; Carol paused &#8212; &#8220;but I don't think they'll try
      anything lethal in public. That's if they can recognize us out of
      uniform &#8212; I'm certain they can't and anyway, if we stay in
      crowds&#8230;&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;That's all very well &#8212; but what do we achieve? What did we
      achieve last night? Tie up or drug a couple of matts, a couple of
      yogis, wound a few more, and they do the same to us. We stay
      thinking one thing, they another.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Why is it that people are so stupid? Us too. If we resort to
      force, we're just as bad as they are. Only luck no-one's been
      killed yet.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Achieve?&#8221; Now it was Carol's turn to sound cynical. &#8220;How can we
      achieve anything? We aren't politicians &#8212; we can only react to
      what's going on. We're being shot at, so why not shoot back?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;But they can't shoot at us if we don't identify ourselves as
      Clan. You said they can't recognize us. But then how can they hole
      up one of us in the museum if they don't know who we are? Or was
      she just jumpy?&#8221;</p>

    <p>Carol didn't reply to Nancy's rhetorical questions. The subject
      had been debated so often before, and always failed to reach
      conclusion. Nancy's gaze roved around the room seeking some anchor
      point, some idea for conversation. She heard, without bothering to
      notice it, Carol setting her glass down. A few moments later,
      Carol's long slender, dextrous fingers began to massage her neck
      and shoulders.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Don't take it too hard, Honey. I'm scared too, when I go out on
      one of these things. Only &#8212; what five days, then we'll be shot of
      this planet. I suppose you saw the news last night.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Yes. I feel scared sick when I think about it. Today's the day,
      then.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Uh oh, I see. The twelfth.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Very &#8216;Oh&#8217; very correct. The final reading of the outlawry
      measures. And vis-&agrave;-vis that news item we were discussing &#8212;
      and not to be a stickler for tradition &#8212; one guess as to our
      chances of a reprieve.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;About zero. They get Aelia, and our only acceptable <a href="annot.html#GenderNeutral">spokes'an</a> is
      gone. I
      doubt Jeanne will be able to work up enough public sympathy to
      swing it, either.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Do you know where we're going to go next?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Not for sure, but I hear gossip. If we can get Guild
      sponsorship, it'll be to a place called Cimarron &#8212; it's just about
      to get its gate. I looked it up. It's about four thousand lites
      swan and a little coreward. One point eight gees. Rather boring
      place, in fact.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Tedious.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Nancy drained her glass.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Eat, or shower first?&#8221; she asked.</p>

    <hr />
    <p>As she had been assured, the weather remained fine during
      lectures, and when they emerged, the massed ranks of clouds were
      gone, only a handful of stragglers remaining. Now revealed, the
      rings poured like misty waterfalls, gossamer veils marring the
      azure perfection of the bowl of the sky, a great ring, set with the
      sun as its begemming.</p>

    <p>The white concrete, so abundantly employed in the construction
      of this complex of buildings flared fiercely in its scarcely
      moderated light. Only the rows of trees along the middles of
      walkways, dividing them into lanes, their dark greens, and the
      greys of the shadows provided haven, directions in which the eye
      could rest without bedazzlement.</p>

    <p>Nancy waited, sitting on the edge of the steps that led up to
      the lecture hall, while Carol went to collect some notes. The wind
      of the early morning had died, or at least was diverted by the
      buildings, and in the sheltered square, the air was almost
      perfectly still, its only movement like the brushing of silk
      against her skin. She closed her eyes, and sat there, basking in
      the warmth of the spring sunshine, relaxing her, feeding her, it
      seemed. She shivered deliciously in the warmth, and smiled. Now,
      for a few brief moments, she could let all the cares of the world
      pass her by, absorbed in that elemental pleasure.</p>

    <p>The hurried footsteps behind her, up and down the steps, might
      belong, any one of them, to friend or foe. She toyed with the idea,
      found it amusing, but all the same, there was the ominous
      expectation of some blow about to land between her
      shoulder-blades.</p>

    <p>And land, such a blow did. A hand, large and unintentionally
      rough, clapped her on the back, and a gruff voice behind her boomed
      &#8220;Evening, Honey.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Nancy started, nearly fell to the path below. She gasped for
      breath, and clutched at her chest as though her heart had failed,
      and with her other hand shielding her eyes from the glare. As the
      tone of the voice had suggested, the speaker was a Hrulgani. But
      though she recognized the mannerism, she could not remember the
      name that went with it.</p>

    <p>&#8220;G'morning. You gave me a fright there. So long since I saw you
      last, I can't remember your name.&#8221;</p>

    <p>The girl, marked as such by the crest of golden hair running
      back from forehead to nape of neck, sudden against the dark brown
      of her pelt, wore a long, short-sleeved dress of some lightweight
      cloth, in white and purple , the colours divided along its vertical
      symmetry. It could clearly be seen that she wore nothing else
      beneath it, her ursine frame as neuter as any teddy-bear, the dress
      only worn for its copious supply of pockets.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Jayso Corvall.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Jayso, of course. Sorry, I'm still not used to all the new faces
      appearing here this term&#8230;&#8221;</p>

    <p>True, but misleading &#8212; Nancy admired her own subtlety.</p>

    <p>Jayso agreed with Nancy's statement, but though she was of one
      of the old and clannish families of the first-in ships, the
      problems of Clan politics had not affected her personally, and she
      was content to reciprocate.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Doing anything special this afternoon? Or are you just hanging
      around to kill time?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Hanging around,&#8221; Jayso replied, &#8220;I'm shot of lectures for the term
      now &#8212; for once I have no need of an excuse to do nothing this
      afternoon.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;You lawyers bitch too much. If you can face some of your courses
      &#8212; symbolic logic, axiom theory, and what is it &#8212; algebraic
      legalistics?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Algebra of legal systems.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;OK, algebra of legal systems &#8212; if you can sit through them, you
      could have done the foundations course in Math, and gotten as much
      free time as we do &#8212; more if you chose your courses right. I've got
      no sympathy for you &#8212; glutton for&#8230; Hey! Carol! Over here!&#8221;
      she waved to her girlfriend, and then hesitated. &#8220;Sorry &#8212; where were
      we? Oh yeah, you didn't have anything set up for this afternoon. We
      don't either.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Tell you what &#8212; we can go to <a href="annot.html#DeansTower">Dean's Tower</a> for
      lunch, then assemble a crowd, and descend on someone. Should keep
      us busy 'til dinner.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Carol walked back up the steps to them.</p>

    <p>&#8220;You going to be all day there?&#8221; she asked.</p>

    <p>&#8220;No &#8212; hey, Carol, this is Jayso Corvall. She's a lawyer.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;No accounting for tastes. Hi!&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;And what do you do?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Math, like Honey. I'm Carol Mastersen, her tutorial partner.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Another mathematician. Is there no escape?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;You could try staying away from our haunts &#8212; like back wherever
      it is you get your lectures. That's out North Pines way, isn't
      it?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;That's right. Say, did I tell you about one of the things that
      happened the other night&#8230;?&#8221;</p>

    <p>Dean's Tower stood in the centre of the site, looking like some
      relict growth, around which the University had built. It seemed
      organic, growing from a broad base to a tall and narrow spire,
      topped with a roughly egg-shaped fruiting body. In contrast to the
      stalactite like veils that constructed and were woven into the
      tower's irregular and constantly changing section, the bulb that
      surmounted it was smooth apart from the seemingly random scatter of
      large gaping widows like eye sockets. Like a forlorn intelligence,
      petrified, and abandoned, it stared sightlessly down at them.</p>

    <p>The three students took a window table in the restaurant in the
      upper part of the tower, a window facing south, and away to the
      green of trees and grass beyond this island of artificiality. They
      talked excitedly, exchanging snippets of gossip, exaggerated tales
      told at third hand with glorious embellishments, but when the meal
      arrived, and mouths were put to alternative use the conversation
      flagged and died, reduced only to the level of Pass the salt. and
      What's that you're eating? It was no surprise &#8212; Carol and Jayso
      hardly knew each other and had little in common to provide
      conversation after the initial rush of talk, while Nancy, their
      interface, was lost in gloomy contemplation.</p>

    <p>The time was but a few minutes after 13:30. In five hours, the
      most crucial parliamentary debate of the planet's history would be
      at last over, at the conclusion of a division already certain. In
      that instant, the old Clans of the Five Castles combine, heirs to a
      thousand years and more of gloriously checkered history, would be
      deemed outlaw, and to claim membership, in any way or means, an
      illegal act, punishable by &#8216;re-education&#8217; a remedy but one step
      short of mindwiping, and about as distasteful.</p>

    <p>Nancy shivered. There was a faction, likely to be little opposed
      after the final count, that pressed for the denial of Linker
      sanctuary to Clan members. They would be welcome to try and take
      the contingent at present safe in the University. Though their
      scattered stockpiles of doomsday weapons might not be able to
      sterilize the whole planet, they could have a damned good try. They
      could make the attempt rather less than cost effective.</p>

    <p>In all probability, self-interest would probably restrain such
      actions, and the Council would pursue an aggressive hands-off
      policy, keeping everything looking fair. Wyvern could ill afford
      the sanctions that the Linkers could impose &#8212; their dependence on
      intersystem trade was still great &#8212; if the system industry was
      blockaded, there would soon be rationing and shortages of high
      technology goods.</p>

    <p>The Castles however, they would be fair game. Any nut with a
      grievance, however imaginary, would be there, with any and every
      weapon they could lay hands on, or simple build. But the resistance
      would not be merely passive, armed as warships of the void, working
      relics of the early days of flight, when they must sail through
      real space between the stars, by ramscoop, twirl or flicker, and
      there be prey to the things that wandered between the starts, the
      Castles could fight back. The fight would last as long as would be
      required. Six days or less and all the Castles would have lifted,
      they only waited now while the lifter units were reset to the new
      configurations of mass. Time &#8212; it was so obscenely short. The
      minutes fled like autumn leaves, rushing headlong as if to find
      some grand finale, and ever eager in their search, mortal man was
      swept along with them.</p>

    <p>Futile anger, formless, and unfocused, welled up like bile,
      furrowing her brow, taking the taste from the food she ate,
      mechanically.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Who shall we call on first?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Uh, what was that, Carol?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Who shall we call on first? Your friends, mine, Jayso's or any
      of the possible combinations?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Whoever's nearest,&#8221; Jayso suggested, &#8220;Sssaa Merissaa is in Cedars
      East, so unless you know anyone in Riverdene or Cedars
      West&#8230;&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;No &#8212; but there's another lawyer I know in Cedars East,&#8221; Nancy,
      swallowing her mouthful, managed to catch Jayso's momentary pause,
      &#8220;A girl called <a href="annot.html#TracyCraig">Tracy Craig</a> &#8212;
      she's from Goldenstone, I think.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Tracy Craig &#8212; you know her? Did you know she's Guild sponsored
      here? And that's not her real name?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;No. Is she O?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Old Clan? No &#8212; her family have connections in the regional
      assembly &#8212; there's some sort of trouble at home, I gather, and
      everyone decided it would be safer to get away from things.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;I thought it was 'cause she was an esper she was Guild
      sponsored.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Could be &#8212; that and influence together do it for certain.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Anyhow, we can take our time &#8212; wait 'til everyone's back from
      lunch first. We can kill half an hour or so in the Archaeology
      museum when we finish here, just to be sure of it.&#8221;</p>

    <hr />
    <p>Nancy surreptitiously steered their path through the museum to
      the level she had crossed just the previous night. What motivated
      her to do that, she was uncertain &#8212; there was curiosity, and a
      desire to do something, prove some vague quality that might be
      courage or equally foolhardiness, to herself. Whichever it might
      be, she could not say, only that she was doing something that in
      either case, seemed totally out of character. For a professed and
      shameless coward, she was acting disturbingly bravely.</p>

    <p>Reassuringly, as she approached her goal, her resolution began
      to fail. She remembered all too well what had happened when she had
      been ensnared by the blue glowing something, how it had drained her
      will, or diverted it, enslaving her body, if not her mind, to its
      bidding. She could only change her mind, though, if she could find
      some valid reason, for now steeled to the task, she doubted if she
      could find the courage again, and always there would be the nag of
      curiosity unsatisfied.</p>

    <p>She let the adrenaline surge expectantly through her system,
      bothering only to conceal her gasping.</p>

    <p>She reached the place, or what she thought was the place &#8212; there
      was so much difference in the daylight &#8212; she turned to the windows,
      and took a deep breath, and another. The desire she had known in
      the dark burned again within her, like a warm ember. She could
      resist that remanent effect, but if she were to wake it to full
      life, she might not be able to.</p>

    <p>Moments, like eternities, passed, and Nancy stayed poised on the
      brink of decision. Then, without reaching any conscious.
      Deliberated, conclusion, she had made the decision, and began to
      structure in her mind the nonsound of the blivit that had woken it
      before.</p>

    <p>As she had feared, something came to life behind her; she could
      feel something that was complete and aware reaching out for her. It
      drove her, fed its insinuations into her mind, but she raised up
      walls of denial. They were to little avail. The attack poured
      through the cracks, like fluid, to lie in the depths of her mind,
      and release its own thoughts.</p>

    <p>It became imperative that she reach it, poor defenceless thing,
      and take it to herself, guard it and keep it, and in return, it
      would give warmth, and comfort, shelter and, most precious gift of
      all, companionship. She loved, yes, truly loved, the thing that
      called her, above and beyond merely desiring it, like some brutish
      beast.</p>

    <p>And she hated, and feared what it was doing to her mind, her
      identity in its barrage.</p>

    <p>Slowly deliberately, she turned, whether under her own volition
      or that of the thing attacking she could not tell, and passing
      between the cases there, came finally to a small display against
      the far wall.</p>

    <p>At last, she could look at the thing that had drawn her. For a
      few instants, she could not see what it was, but then it drew her
      gaze, and held it. It was a necklet, or some similar ornament, a
      chain of one inch links, wrought of fine wire &#8212; platinum according
      to the label &#8212; to hold a square, an inch and a half on a side, of
      the same silvery metal. Set in it exquisitely cut, a stone
      identified only by a classification of its internal structure, and
      the name of its finder. Fiery glows chased and flickered in its
      blue-violet depths.</p>

    <p>Beautiful it was, beautiful as she herself measured beauty, on a
      scale she knew had not fallen to its assault. Her defences
      trembled; she could not believe that harm could come from something
      so precious, but deep within her being, where yet she was an
      animal, she feared and that brutish will maintained the barriers
      with all the sheer intransigence she could summon.</p>

    <p>She watched, as if from outside of herself, from the sidelines
      of the conflict between her id and the entity in the necklace. Her
      arm drew back, the fingers clenched into a fist, ready to break the
      glass that imprisoned the jewel. The whole power of her conscious
      mind she threw into the battle, to try and stop that blow, but it
      seemed she had forgotten how to control her body. The arm twitched,
      the muscles spasmed, and cramping pains chipped away at her
      strength, and yet that alien will, tireless, immune, continued the
      struggle to dominance.</p>

    <p>The position could be held static, but it took all her efforts
      to hold it so; and had she not expected that mode of attack, she
      might have unwittingly given in. The game was yet only in check,
      and not mate. She would face the greater test, and if luck favoured
      her, she would prevail. It seemed reasonable to her, in the light
      of last night's events, that to break the enchantment, she would
      have to break first the memory of the demonic wailing that
      continued, half heard, in the background of the world. Some formal
      prayer, some litany that she knew, believed and could place all her
      faith in, be it unto death : that focus, she was sure, would be the
      best way, the surest agent, but she acknowledged no deity, had
      learned no ritual, could petition no power in that hour of need.
      Now, for the first time, she regretted that aid and comfort that
      she had rejected, however illusory it might be, but she allowed
      herself only an instant of that, and began to execute the plan she
      had devised for her own escape.</p>

    <p>Mechanically, monotonously, she began to recite to herself the
      lyrics of the first song she could dredge out of her memory. Then,
      to the cycle of words, she began to force the music, slowly, again
      and again, strengthening at each repetition, while the words became
      just meaningless jumbles of potential sound. No matter, its
      invocation continued to cycle over the music which was gaining the
      shape that the words lost. At last, in a sudden quantum jump
      transition, the hellsound in her mind snapped like a thread of
      steel. The music rose to take its place, coming perfectly to
      flower, and it played triumphally, with all the will she had
      mustered to the struggle against invasion, and with all the joy of
      victory. It was like a mighty river, and it could wash away all the
      tainting of her mind.</p>

    <p>Her fist, unnoticed during the turn of the mind war, was now
      bare inches from the glass and the whole arm was distorted, cramped
      and unusable. Sweat drenched her body, and her breath came in loud,
      ragged gasps. She was half afraid that she had begun to sing out
      loud at the crescendo of conflict. Warily, she looked around for
      Carol and Jayso : they still browsed the displays, and appeared to
      have noticed nothing untoward happening.</p>

    <p>She looked down at the vanquished foe. The metal seemed to have
      become duller, leaden and the gem had clouded to an opaque,
      lustreless grey-green; but it was not dead, but merely quiescent &#8212;
      it still cast its allure. Next time, assuming that such a match was
      brought to pass, next time that she faced the construct she knew
      that she could, as a matter of sheer dispassion, break the power as
      she had broken it just. Raw power, however, was not its weapon but
      the ability to sap the will. It might be that she just didn't want
      to resist &#8212; even at the time of victory, she had tasted that
      uncertainty. There was nothing, as a point of sober fact, nothing
      whatsoever to indicate that its purpose was, what use it had for
      her.</p>

    <p>Clumsily, with an arm reluctant to do her bidding, she wiped her
      forehead, and pushed her hair back into place. Had she been alone,
      she would have left immediately, and with all haste, but she was
      not; and the desire that nothing at all that might be considered
      unusual should be brought to the notice of others was stronger than
      the urge to flight. She stood a few minutes watching her reflection
      in the glass and waiting for the suggestion that they leave. She
      herself was on the verge of that suggestion, when Carol, checking
      her watch, declared that it was after two o'clock, and a suitable
      time for them to leave.</p>

    <p>Nancy agreed, and followed her lead, keeping her feeling of
      relief secret to herself</p>

    <hr />
    <p>It was gone 18:00 when finally she managed to disengage herself
      from what had become a floating group of about twenty people. She
      had lost count of how much she had eaten, how many cups of tea and
      coffee she had consumed, as many supplied by total strangers as
      supplied by friends. She had excused herself by saying that she
      wanted to get an early dinner, though the only thoughts she had of
      food were ideas of how to gain a respite from it. Behind her
      fabrication two ideas drove her : first the wish to find out how
      the debate on the motion of outlawry went, the second to escape the
      party. She was there beyond many of her social group, and the whole
      tone of the gathering was changed. There were a growing number of
      people she felt uncomfortable to be near, the more physical types,
      sports fiends, boisterous socializers of what Nancy considered the
      lowest kind.</p>

      <div class="hide">
        <div style="padding:5px;border: black 1px solid;text-align: center;background-color: #eee;color:inherit">
          <img height="592" width="440" src="00936-1635810656.png" />
          <p>Gliding home</p>
        </div>
      </div>  

    <p>She was thankfully alone on the slideway, speeding along, and
      totally free from the constraints of being with people. The sun
      shone bright as it descended to the horizon, but already she could
      look momentarily at its disk, and the air was already chill.
      especially in the unrelieved shade. She had chosen her route to
      follow the eastern side of the valley of the Greywater, inasmuch as
      its meanderings possessed an eastern side but even there, the hills
      across the valley cast long shadows that reached over and up to the
      path.</p>

    <p>In brief glimpses through the trees to her right she could see
      the river, its waters as steely as its name suggested, pouring
      turbulently over its bed of grey rock.</p>

    <p>Around her waist, on a belt of white leather, she now wore
      openly the gun that she had carried secretly all that day. In that
      she had not been alone. Carol had carried one, that she herself had
      loaned to her, and she had noticed a couple of people whom she
      suspected of being matts, also displaying slight bulges that were
      either the mark of sloppy tailoring &#8212; unlikely &#8212; or concealed guns
      &#8212; almost certainly. If there was an ambush set up and waiting for
      her, she would be ready.</p>

    <p>But ambush there was none, and as she came closer to the more
      travelled routes about her own college of Greenhollow, she buttoned
      up her jacket to cover the gun &#8212; the whipping of the hem in the
      slipstream would adequately conceal its shape. She began the
      manoeuvre into the lane she would want at the interchange.</p>

    <hr />
    <p>She entered her house only after approaching cautiously from out
      of the woods, and then by one of the windows, where she had placed
      her own security lock. It might not be strictly necessary, but it
      was fun, and it provided a sense of the dramatic.</p>

    <p>Having gained the sanctuary of her room, she headed straight
      away to the console in the main room, calling for the Tree-V to be
      switched on, to catch a summary of the debate.</p>

    <p>It was all proceeding to the pattern she had expected, there had
      been not one surprise, one last minute change of alignment. The
      speeches, the jibes, had all been old and tiredly familiar, heavy
      with empty rhetoric that gleamed and conveyed no information &#8212; one
      speech of twenty minutes was auto-summarized succinctly as Someone
      should do something about this, you know.</p>

    <p>Tired, haggard, and pompous, all the speakers were following,
      for what seemed the thousandth time, the same hypocritical
      choreography that had been established on the first play of the
      issue. Disgusted with the endless childishness of politics, she
      turned on the live coverage.</p>

    <p>The summing up was beginning, with the three faction leaders in
      the Senate opening. The Land-owners' representative had finished
      the elaborate rituals, and began the speech. He spoke eloquently,
      and said nothing, a self parody on the party's proverbial lack of
      policy, and it was a relief to hear some clear statement of intent
      from the Young Clans albeit an affirmation that they had been
      bought body and soul by interstellar big business. Standing to gain
      most in the short term from a peaceful removal of the Old Clans
      they urged the acceptance of the motion under a stay of execution
      of one week, to safeguard lives and property all round.</p>

    <p>The Lady Jeanne took the floor next, and the whole assembly fell
      silent. This was the important speech, by it the Clans would stand
      or fall in the eyes of the jurisdiction. She spoke tersely, and to
      the point, an event unprecedented in those hallowed halls, and
      common sense, an equally new, face in the gathering, was its
      mainstay.</p>

    <p>The Clans, she argued, were going to leave, within the week.
      There was no need for this law, and it would be a point merely of
      honour in its winning or losing. If people really wanted to slit
      their own throats, Jeanne bad no objections, provided they did not
      bleed on her carpet, or leave a mess to dispose of.</p>

    <p>There was nothing of politics in her speech, she knew the debate
      already, to be lost, so she spoke her mind, naming names of those
      with interests in corporations with declared aims on Wyvern.
      Magnificently wrathful, she ignored the jeers of &#8220;Royalist!&#8221; or
      &#8220;Dictator!&#8221; &#8212; catchphrases of their opponents, they had lost their
      meanings, and so she spoke as if through the hubbub of a farmyard,
      her face burning with a joyous exhilaration. Blood they seemed to
      want, so blood in copious quantities would she supply them &#8212; their
      own here by words, but were battle joined, the, blood would be
      real.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Honesty!&#8221; she called, &#8220;whatever else, we do, we must have honesty
      &#8212; if you've been bought &#8212; like the honourable members I named, have
      the good grace to say so. If you believe in a cause &#8212; like you
      think the Guild oughtn't have a monopoly of long haul trade, say
      it. If you just hate our guts because your family always have, say
      so. I've just this one speech here as leader of the Old Clans &#8212; let
      me at least leave you with the <a href="annot.html#YahBoo">custom of honesty</a>.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I think you are all bloody stupid. If you think you can run a
      planet better than we do, you ought to go somewhere else, and stake
      a claim, not try to jump ours. If you think our collaboration with
      the Guild is bad, argue with the Guild. We were here first, we
      built this planet up to civilization, we supplied the kernel of the
      system economy, and then you think you can just edge us out.</p>

    <p>&#8220;We're bending over to accommodate you, and not a word of
      gratitude do we get. If you really want to lose credibility as a
      thinking, reasoning being, vote for the Bill. Hell &#8212; we're going
      anyway next week. Are you bloodsuckers not content with that?</p>

    <p>&#8220;Think before you vote, all of you &#8212; and think more than two days
      into the future &#8212; you don't know when this could be used against
      you. Thank you.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Jeanne sat down, she looked old and tired, every one of her more
      than eleven hundred years etched on her face. Weary and small, she
      turned to her companions, while the camera turned to show the next
      speaker.</p>

    <p>What applause there was came from those sections of the hall
      dedicated to the Clans, and it was weak, and drowned out in the
      jeering, and it continued for the next speaker, the leader of the
      Traditionalist party who would also throw his support behind the
      Clans. His speech was less emotive, more strictly parliamentary
      than Jeanne's, and even his support was lukewarm. He would have to
      stay behind and try to survive in the new political climate after
      the departure of the Clans, so was trying to show his supporters
      that he remained faithful, yet able to respond to the imminent
      change. His was an unenviable situation, his stable platform torn
      away in the sudden and dramatic about turn in the vocal consensus
      on the Clans, and it was all that he could do to survive, but even
      so, me managed to make a good argument opposing the motion on
      purely economic grounds.</p>

    <p>The Moderate leader, who followed, though nominally not in
      favour of the clan system and the monopoly of trade negotiations
      the Combine had held, was at pains to make clear that equally he
      was not in favour of the extremes urged by the more vocal
      opposition, and on those grounds called that the motion be voted
      for amendment only. He sat down to only a ripple of applause. The
      vote that was answered by the reaction of the council showed what
      appeared to be a great decline in their fortunes and the roar of
      applause for the leader of the Populists showed whom the rabble
      appreciated most.</p>

    <p>The speech he made was neither as cogent as those made already
      from the floor, nor as straight spoken as Jeanne's. Windy, packed
      with cliched rhetoric and vituperation, it served no other purpose
      than to sway the weak willed to his cause, and to exhort the ranks
      of the &#8216;converted&#8217;. As a perfect textbook example of the procedure,
      it could not be faulted, but the total lack of intellect behind it
      appalled Nancy. The speaker conjured up visions of a better future
      when the healthy stimulus of the larger interstellar corporations
      came into the system, but did not mention that the same combines
      would be able to just buy them without even thinking about the
      cost. In the name of freedom he would open Pandora's box, and the
      unthinking men who listened, cheered with all their might.</p>

    <p>The closing speech, was by the leader of the council, and of the
      majority Republican party. He said little in his speech, trying to
      sail between the Scylla of the Combine, and the Charybdis of their
      opponents, and succeeded in being, shouted down by both factions at
      once, in a rare display of common purpose. Eventually, however, it
      emerged that he wanted people to accept the measure, but to leave
      the degree of acceptance to their own conscience. Thus knowing,
      that a vote to amend would take more than a week to process, he had
      neatly sat down on the fence, which satisfied the party's division
      on the matter.</p>

    <p>He called for the votes to be cast, and, to a storm of applause,
      sat down. For some minutes, there was a pause, and then figures
      came up, both on the score-board in the Council Chamber, and
      synthesized on the screen:</p>

    <p><a href="annot.html#VotingSystem">So close the verdict</a>,
      despite the vocal bias against the Combine.
      Had four fewer people registered acceptances from the floor, or
      fifteen more of the Senators rejected the Bill, it would have gone
      to a Select Committee for amendment, there to be lost. Now, it had
      been ratified, and she was outlaw on that planet.</p>

    <p>She felt sick &#8212; how many people, especially in the Young Clans,
      had supported this, thinking, that they were safe from similar
      action? Far too many, she felt. One day, the precedent of Outlawry
      might be used to drive Young Clans, or the Land-owners into exile,
      so that a grateful People's Corporation could reap their profits.
      People did not change. They always had been blind to the days after
      tomorrow, and would presumably continue to be. One day, in the long
      run, the Partnership would come up against a society in which all
      its members could think on truly long term time scales, and would
      promptly go under.</p>

    <p>She wondered idly, could that be the secret behind the success
      of the Linkers' Guild. Perhaps simply that was their long hidden
      secret. Perhaps &#8212; fooey!</p>

    <p>On impulse, she tapped out her sister's phone number. The screen
      flickered for a few seconds, hazed over with static, and <a href="annot.html#DigitalImages">then stabilized</a>.
      For a
      subliminal instant, a message appeared, red characters on black,
      but before she could read any of it, it had gone, to be replaced by
      a picture; a girl of the clan, floating against a background of
      billowing colour, predominantly green, with islands of blue and
      orange. The girl's hair was grey, but in places was streaked with
      black. Her face was chillingly beautiful, innocent and eternal.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Hi, Jenny &#8212; where's Tracy?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Out in the grounds somewhere. I'm sending out a <a href="annot.html#MobilePhone">mobile unit</a> to find
      her. I suppose you're calling about the vote in the Council,
      just.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Only indirectly. A part of this is to kill time before I go to
      dinner. How's the move going your end?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Still on schedule &#8212; five days, give or take a few hours. Then
      up, up and away. Perhaps this time we'll be lucky, and find a place
      to stay more than a couple of hundred years. It gets a girl down,
      all this moving about. Ah! &#8212; I've got Tracy on the line.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;OK, put her through. See you soon, Jenny.&#8221;</p>

    <p>The simulated picture collapsed, to be replaced by a view of
      Nancy's sister. She was sitting on a rock, and beyond her, the land
      sloped away to a valley lightly dotted with elegantly cut trees,
      like dark grey lollipops against the paler grey of the grass. Their
      shadows were blotchy pools of darkness about their feet. All was
      colourless in the ring glow.</p>

    <p>The audio channel carried the low sighing of the night wind, and
      the distant sound of the sea.</p>

    <p>There in the foreground, however, dominating the scene, was
      Tracy. After the idealization of the Clan's design, slim, boyish,
      even neuter; for a female, comparatively hard-bodied, that was the
      construct image of Genevieve, the Castle's sentient computer, Tracy
      came as a surprise. She was aggressively pregnant &#8212; had been so for
      several years &#8212; and if, and when, she decided to permit the birth,
      it would be the third such in the history of the clan.</p>

    <p>Even without that, she would still seem to be asserting her
      femininity. She had always seemed plump, compared with her peers,
      but what seemed buxom to those accustomed to Clan tradition seemed
      slim, or at least normal, to those outside.</p>

    <p>&#8220;You've heard the results?&#8221; Nancy asked.</p>

    <p>&#8220;No. I presume we lost. How much by?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;That much.&#8221; She held up thumb and forefinger, a quarter inch
      apart. &#8220;Two dozen votes would have turned it. So you don't know when
      we're going to be hauled home?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Not for sure. Tomorrow, probably, tomorrow your time, that is.
      Though I'd say you were safer at Uni &#8212; lots of Linkers around so
      you can run for help &#8212; we've had a couple of snipers already, just
      trying to take out windows mainly, but a couple of people have been
      hurt.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I'm just taking a chance to get out and about before the siege
      closes in for good. If you want to find out what's really
      happening, I should think Mum would know.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Mm &#8212; well, I'll find out in good time. I mainly called to waste
      time before dinner. We can save all the gossip 'til I get home
      again. Be seeing you then, Tracy.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;And you, Nancy. Bye.&#8221;</p>

    <p>They blew each other kisses as the picture faded, and Nancy
      leaned back in her chair, suddenly happy. She had been speaking
      with someone who just clicked with her, despite the fifty year
      difference in their ages. She also found herself longing wistfully
      for Carol, but even she was just a little too far away in spirit to
      match so much.</p>

    <p>&#8220;The time is 19:15, my Lady.&#8221; Melanie's announcement startled her
      into sitting bolt upright.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Thanks!&#8221;</p>

    <p>She stripped to her underwear, throwing the cast-off garments to
      be cleaned, and rummaging in the chaos of her wardrobe. At the
      bottom of one side, she came across the dress she sought, ankle
      length, sleeveless, and midnight blue in colour, and with it,
      matching ankle boots. For one last time, she would go out looking
      smart, and not dressed to hide a weapon. The dining hall was two
      hundred yards away, and even in her mediocre state of physical
      fitness it would be only half a minute's run.</p>

    <p>She pulled the garment on, and her gown, and pausing only to
      tidy her hair, departed.</p>

          <p>Heading to Hall</p>
        </div>
      </div>  

    <hr />
    <p>She sat down in the dining hall, and as soon as she had settled
      down to wait for the meal to begin, she regretted the decision to
      leave her gun behind. Too many people seemed to be crowding in, and
      there was something not quite true about the mood of the gathering,
      and she reached helplessly for the gun she had left behind. The
      hairs on her neck bristled, and the stench of wrongness burned in
      her nostrils.</p>

    <p>No-one else seemed to notice it. About her, the trivial chatter
      of daily life went on as usual, unheeding of the warnings. She felt
      that she must stand up and call out her warning, but what senses
      advised her of the tension, and what precisely she could sense, she
      could not say, and without that firm assurance, she was unwilling
      to be made to look foolish in public. She sat at the table,
      fretting., and tearing distractedly at a piece of bread.</p>

    <p>A Hrulgani male, black furred and green eyed, his mane vast and
      silky, sat down beside her. Like Nancy, his gown bore the silver
      trim of a scholar.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Evening, Honey, I'm Esteen &#8212; I'm&#8221; &#8212; he touched thumb and
      forefinger briefly together &#8212; &#8220;too.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Evening.&#8221; Nancy looked around, quickly, to check what their
      neighbours were doing, and saw no-one interested in them.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Keep this to yourself,&#8221; she whispered, &#8220;but I think something's
      going to go up during dinner. You armed?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Uh huh. Two needlers &#8212; but a roust &#8212; here &#8212; you must be joking &#8212;
      how do you know?&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;A rumour going around. Could you lend me a gun &#8212; I didn't bring
      any of mine.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Okay then. Here.&#8221;</p>

    <p>The butt of the weapon nudged against her thigh and she clasped
      it in her hand, and rested it on her lap. She clung to it as if it
      were endowed with powerful charms of protection, and thanked
      Esteen.</p>

    <p>Across the hall, a gong sounded, triggering off first a
      quietening of the talk, and then an explosion of rasping noises as
      chairs and benches were pushed away, as their occupants stood. The
      fellows filed in, led by the Mistress of the College, Linker Jean
      McRae, she in the black and silver formal dress of the Guild, an
      outfit that seemed almost to drip with diamonds and platinum Behind
      her, in their drab academic dress the high ranking philosophers of
      the College.</p>

    <p>An idea took root in Nancy's mind, growing to horrible fruition,
      an idea as to the event that she seemed to be forewarned of. Surely
      there could be no-one so bereft of his senses, no-one so
      philistine, as to try to murder in cold blood, a Linker, and ten or
      more of the finest minds on the planet. Though the academics would
      be unable to defend themselves with any vigour, a Linker, hampered
      though she might be by the twisting, of space-time in such close
      proximity to matter, would be able to more than adequately defend
      against any conceivable threat.</p>

    <p>She tried to set that idea aside, but it would not budge, until
      a more outrageous idea supplanted it &#8212; the matts might not try for
      the fellows, but for the Clanfolk. Personal danger, however
      unlikely, managed to wonderfully concentrate her mind. If they had
      found out the faces to fit the names of Wolf, Connors, Brady, Tsia,
      Shan and Min-Ko&euml;, by whatever unlikely means, they would use
      that knowledge to the full&#8230;</p>

    <p>She ate the soup course left-handed, the gun ready in her right
      hand to fire at the slightest irregularity. Despite the tension,
      however, there were no noticeable deviations from the norm of
      procedure. Glasses clinked, and silver cups. Conversation was a low
      formless roar punctuated by occasional expletives, and the robot
      servants wheeled around in mathematically precise patterns,
      dispensing food, and drink.</p>

    <p>Her bowl emptied, and was taken away, but still the aura, of
      danger remained and had even grown into a feeling of tautness. She
      eyed suspiciously the plate handed to her, but the meat and
      vegetables offered no threat, but the threat existed, and was close
      by.</p>

    <p>Though suspicious, she began to eat, ignoring what the food
      tasted like, too preoccupied&#8230;</p>

    <p>Then, the tension snapped, and a feeling of relief surged for an
      instant in her. The doors had opened, and through each filed half a
      dozen people. Each wore camouflaged combat uniforms, and carried a
      variety of home-made and commercial weapons, and on the breast of
      each the emblem of the Matts, a green globe, bound around with with
      a broken chain.</p>

    <p>Silence, descended with a roar, 'til there was no sound but that
      of the robot waiters and of breathing. Nancy halted in the action
      of bringing a piece of food to her mouth, and there were many
      others stopped, as if frozen, in the actions of eating, The freeze
      lasted a few seconds and slowly people began to place down their
      cutlery, and to edge forwards in their seats, to get a better
      view.</p>

    <p>When all was again settled, a further group entered, a girl,
      with the rank badges of lieutenant, escorted by two Hrulgani. She
      dismissed the guard halfway up the Wall, and continued alone, up to
      the high table. She looked disdainfully at what she saw, and then
      vaguely nodded to Mistress McRae.</p>

    <p>&#8220;My Lady. In the name of the Free People's Command of the Planet
      Wyvern, I demand that all members of the Old Clans, now by due
      process of law pronounced outlaw, be handed over to us. We will
      then take them to trial on charges of oppression against the
      peoples of the planets of Lindisfarne, Starbow, Luthien,
      Sharrowhan, Kalarim, Heartward, Toehold and Last Gasp.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Jean laughed. &#8220;You ask me, in the name of an organization that is
      politically unrecognized, and in pursuance of a law which was
      passed by a body with no jurisdiction here to hand people over to
      trial for crimes committed before their births.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Are you insane?&#8221;</p>

    <p>Exit one propaganda scoop, though Nancy. But that was only one
      facet. In her response, Jean McRae had brought the situation to a
      region of instability. In that instant of chaos, a chair squeaked
      loudly as its occupant rose to his feet. He carried a heavy handgun
      which must have been almost impossible to conceal.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Conversely,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I see you support the cause of Matthew
      Hayward, or at least you wear his badge.&#8221;</p>

    <p>&#8220;Be quiet,&#8221; snapped the girl.</p>

    <p>&#8220;You too &#8212; Hayward was no saint &#8212; Or do you not remember his
      atrocities?&#8221;</p>

    <p>The situation screamed for release.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Shut up, I'm warning you!&#8221; the lieutenant shrieked.</p>

    <p>&#8220;<a href="annot.html#Danestar">The massacres of the
        spread owners on Danestar</a>, or the friendly
      hobbies of his secret police&#8230;&#8221;</p>

    <p>The speaker paused, aware of what his coldly angry speech had
      done. The was a pause, while the matts tried to keep everyone in
      line simultaneously, and while Nancy tried to think of a way to
      avoid harm in the coming shoot-out. Very soon, people might very
      well be hurt, and the idea did not appeal to her.</p>

    <p>Some item of cutlery dropped to the floor, and momentarily
      diverted attention. Someone, trigger happy, fired a few shots, and
      the room exploded into action. Nancy hurled her plate at the
      nearest matt, and as he ducked, pushed the table forwards, and
      hauled her gun from under it, and held the trigger down. Her fire
      caught two before anyone noticed, but the third target fired back,
      using a lethal projectile weapon. He missed, but began to correct
      his aim, and Nancy sprayed needles in his direction. In those
      frantic milliseconds, something happened to the universe,
      distorting its laws. A sub-machinegun had opened fire, and the
      sound of it rolled slowly across the room, like the sound of
      distant ocean swell. The bullets too were slowed, arcing lazily
      across the room, to bounce, their momentum spent, from anything
      they hit.</p>

    <p>The quality of the light changed, becoming purplish black in
      essence, and distances and directions were distorted as if in a
      mirror insanely warped, or as if by the effects of hallucinogens.
      Even her body had been twisted, and her viewpoint wrenched loose
      from it.</p>

    <p>In that sea of madness, figures moved, veiled in a
      mother-of-pearl mist, totally unaffected by its effects, and even
      seeming to reimpose reality about themselves.</p>

    <p>Then, as suddenly as it came, the distortion ceased. The matts
      were missing, the tables moved slightly from alignment, but apart
      from that, all seemed as before. The tension was stilled, and only
      a bewildered silence filled the air. Jean McRae hammered on the
      table with a spoon, and the incipient buzz of conversation was
      stifled.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I wish to apologize to those of you caught unwillingly in this
      situation. I hope none of you have suffered discomfort from the
      effects of the <a href="annot.html#Qdebel">Qbedel field</a>, but this deep in
      a gravity well, it's not precisely controllable.</p>

    <p>&#8220;Those of you who resisted force with force, did, I feel, follow,
      what would have been the best course, had there been no Linkers
      present. However, I would like to remind you that the <a href="annot.html#GunControl">carrying of
        weapons in the University is forbidden</a> so I would ask
      you to leave your guns behind as you go.</p>

    <p>&#8220;There were four deaths, and a dozen people were injured, but
      they are all in hospital now Most of them will be out again by
      morning, though I gather that one girl who was killed may need to
      be kept in for a couple of days while her heart heals .Now get on
      with your meals.&#8221;</p>

    <p>Nancy checked her watch. Incredibly, ten minutes had gone by
      while they had been under the Qbedel field. Even more than before,
      she felt certain that to attack a Linker was rank folly for any
      normal person, and many supernormal ones besides. The magnitude of
      the effect, produced by maybe ten of them at an instant's notice,
      showed what a powerful weapon it must have been in the wars of the
      28th and 29th centuries, when hundreds of minds had combined to
      saturate planets with its influence so that small teams of Linkers
      could go down and take over governance without a drop of blood
      being shed.</p>

    <p>Another point that had come out of the incident was the reaction
      to the pro-Clan resistance. For someone supposedly unbiased by
      profession, in all matters of politics, Linker McRae seemed rather
      to side with the clans and those who had demonstrated their active
      sympathy for them. Nancy had expected to undergo much the same
      treatment as the matts, and an equal punishment meted out, but she
      had not even been hindered. The reaction of relief left her feeling
      weak at the knees, dazed and slightly soggy for the rest of the
      meal.</p>

    <p>As she returned to her room, through the darkening gloom of
      evening, where only the palest of sunsets remained, she wondered
      whether that had been a desperate last fling by the matts, or the
      beginning of an intensified campaign, both from within and without
      the University. In either case, she would not care to sleep alone
      that night, and that not for pleasure, but with the practical aim
      of allowing a watch to be kept.</p>
